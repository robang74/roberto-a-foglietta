### Introduction

Communism is the ideology for which taking away from their owners the means of production is a good thing because a collective management could better address the surplus of production. History and games theory demonstrates that ideas are doomed to fail and, moreover, to bring people more suffering, more poverty and less freedom.

Unfortunately, proletarian communism (by [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx#Thought)) is not the only form of communism but there are many other ways to implement the same ideology with the same disastrous outcome. One of them is financial communism and surprisingly is what is going on in the Western. Thus, we need to understand how it works.

---

### From the gold to the fiat-currency

Those printing paper money are communists not socialists: financial communists instead of proletarian communist but it is the same way of thinking - stealing people to centralize the control of the wealth thus imposing their will over them.

Why are they financial communists? It is quite simple to explain. Because gold is quite difficult to manage and trade. Who grants me that the piece of gold is pure gold? Who grants that your sling-bar scale is precise?

Thus, the coin with a facial value - the "*facial*" came from who put their face on it to grant the value (the emperor, the king, the pope, etc.) - and people accept the facial value despite the ruler might trick them with the coin metals.

The difference between the nominal value and the value of metals in the coin is called "*functional value gap*". People accepted to be tricked because it is easier to trade with standard coins rather than exchange goods. How much are they keen to be tricked?

At this point they are keen to use banknotes (or certificates) that are granted to be exchanged in gold, possibly. Possibly as long as everyone asks for changing it with gold, naturally. Then the fiat-currency appears.

---

### From fiat-currency to quantitative easing

Then the fiat-currency appears and because it is a scam, the scam is perpetrated by private institutions. It would be unacceptable that a public authority would carry on a scam.

They did, they have been caught and they have been forced to give away that scam in favor of those carried on with it but cleaning their reputation.

Now, a private institution cannot print money and use it. The scam would be too easy to be revealed and it would end pretty soon. So, they wait for corrupted politicians and lobbyists to decide to use more paper money and thus they put on the market bonds.

The state bonds - in USA federal state bonds - is like asking people to trust in their government and give them more resources. This authorities the government to increase the taxation pressure, in percentage or in number of the taxes.

It is a vicious cycle which brings politics more and more dependent from increasing their budget, thus public debt, thus tax pressure. In the same way, lobbyists and banks go for the same way because whoever stops is dead (default).

Here we are, with quantitative easing. A monetary policy that progressively increases the primary monetary mass (M1), thus the secondary (M2) - usually 50x bigger than M1 - and the M3, also.

---

### From the quantitative easing to the ww3

The M2 are loans and usually are secured unless subprime loans became a thing. The M3 is everything else generated by any other kind of financial leverages.

In one way or another, M3 is the speculative betting volume. A lot of complications masquerade such mechanism but in the essence is quite easy:

* **M1** - public debt

* **M2** - loans (50x)

* **M3** - bets (unlimited, virtually)

Now consider that M1 is a huge number multiplied two times for 50 thus M1 x 2.500 is an immense amount of paper money (assets securitisation) that has little of counterpart granted in real world.

It is like selling the same gold bar multiple times to multiple people. Everyone has a certificate of deposit and pays a fee over that but they suppose to gain by the gold value raising. The day that too many people want their gold bar back, the system collapses.

In the monetary-financial system, it does not even exist the gold bar to grant the paper money but the big-red-button. Do not dare to oppose to us because we can destroy the world with our nuclear bombs.

----

### Notes about the terminology

Because words matter, we are going to spend a few minutes in understating their real meaning in order to understand how financial communism derives from a dystopic use of quantitative easing and public debt inflation.

Notice that "*assets securitisation*" is translated in Italian as "*cartolarizzazione delle attività*" which literally means "*makes paper from your activities*" where "*activities*" means anything that has a positive outcome, the opposite of a debt but broader as an idea than a credit.

Notice that communism can exist only in an economic system that has a lot of productive means and those means are capable of providing a production surplus.

Because underdeveloped poor economies are based on solidarity: no fridge, we store food in our guts.

Notice that economy, etymologically, came from two Greek words `οἰκονομία` (house) and `οἶκος` (administration) because it was about the house administration, literally. Its meaning is strictly related to scarcity and its proper administration.

---

### Economics: the scarcity and its administration

Thus, when there is no scarcity, there is no economy. In fact, no scarcity, no moderation in using something that is unlimited. Time is for its intrinsic nature a scarcity good. Once you have lost your time, it will not return back.

So, we can consider an asset like a factory or a farm. This is also an activity because it produces more economic (real) value than how much it consumes (e.g. grass into milk).

We can make a securitisation of that asset: we go to the authority, we claim that we own that farm and the authority after some checks, release us a certificate of property plus they register our name into their property registry in such a way anyone else cannot claim our farm for its own.

---

### From securitisation to cartolarisation

This securitisation is also a cartolarisation (paperwork) and we can go into another city and sell our property but instead of bringing the new owner to our farm, we just give the ownership paperwork with a transfer contract. It is a great idea, securitisation!

Unfortunately cartolarisation (paperwork) can also create HUGE problems. Imagine that you go to the authority office and ask for many ownership certificates and you pay $1 for each. Then you start to travel along toward the far-wet and in each city you go, you sell your farm for $100.

Do you see the problem? This is a scam but it can be even worse when the scam is carried on by a systemic scale and becomes the norm. Like, everyone that paid $100 had printed them. Not by themselves in person but thanks to a bank giving YOUR farm as collateral to the debt.

Now there is a lot of money around and this kind of scam can grow bigger and faster because more money is more expensive than real assets costs. Which is inflation, precisely.

Inflation is not production. The surplus value (added value) is just related to numbers which are unlimited not about real think that are naturally scarce like the gallons of milks that a cow can produce.

----

### From capitalism to the financial communism

The securitisation of a real-world asset is about capitalism, about the natural right of the owner to leverage their propriety for their own good sake. However, not completely at their own will in order to avoid damage to others.

So, step by step, it happens that now we have (1) fiat-currency, (2) quantitative easing policy enforced for many years in order to (3) inflate the total {M1, M2, M3} monetary mass and (4) lot of productive means.

Hence, financial communism can start. Well, it started a long time ago but now they should not have to conceal themselves behind tricks. In fact, ex CIA directors started to admit publicly that they did many nasty things around the world. The Nobel prize goes to the US president that keeps alive most wars that anyone else. And so on and on and on.

Because, at this point they have enough money to buy anything they want. A brilliant founder raised up an ethical business, taking care of employees who take care of their customers. A business that nicely works with those providing goods to the company and with the company are carefully involved in nature preservation.

---

### How financial communism works

Imagine a company - like the original [Olivetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti#Computers) company - innovative, social caring, successful, and everyone loves them, buying from them, working for them or selling to them - then someone arrives and puts a pile of paper money up-up until the owner sells his company.

But the owner does not want to sell that company because everyone loves it and also s/he loves it. Then a pile of money, up and up, is offered to everyone that can convince the founder/owner to sell its lovable creature.

As much in nominal value as the paper money pile grows up, more people get interested in this "*deal*". It is not their own business, but now it shows a kind of on which they can win something for themselves.

---

### Financial communism can kill

As much in nominal value as the paper money pile grows, stronger grows the pressure on the founder/owner to sell the company but s/he is hard to beat and s/he remains firmly rooted on the "*no selling*" option.

S/he finally dies in a tragic and strange incident, the first engineer, the wo/man that could have replaced the owner and carried on the company as it was supposed to be, s/he also dies or gets seriously ill or both.

Finally, the company is sold or made irrelevant. Finally, the paper money defrauded the owner from his own propriety and in doing this that means of production gets under the control of the paper money issuers (those prints paper money).

---

### Financial communism is true communism.

Even if it leverages financial instruments instead of ideology.

Wait, the current economic and financial system isn't based on wrong and obsolete assumptions that are kept enforced as dogmas? Yes!

Yes, also financial communism is based on some kind of ideology which is nothing else than a structure of ideas based on some dogmas that cannot be challenged and thus are enforced.

Those who are against financial communism are proletarian communists. Or simply communists. It sounds like a satiric and absurd sketch by Monty Python but that's it, it is real!

Hence, a bounce of people that enforced over others some dogmas throughout the scam of paper money got the control (or made irrelevant) the right of the founder/owner of a productive means.

---

### Financial communism outcome is the same, also

They stole it. No more, no less, but simply as that: they stole it (or destroyed it).

In both cases they enforced their will over the productive means that are providing a surplus and negated the owners natural right to HAVE and CONTROL those productive means. Communism!

Every kind of currency that can be issued in an unlimited amount - soon or later - will develop financial capitalism. They pretty clearly know this. It is wrong to suppose that they did not know this.

Despite this and because of this, they claim to fight communism, even better if it requires printing more money. Which is exactly what happened after Breton Wood, after 9/11 and Ukraine crisis aka WW3 event ignition.

---

### A further reading, for a deeper understanding

Six weeks after this article has been written, I realised that the concept of "**Paper Money**" - a legacy tender printed by thin air - was not as common among people as I was thinking, initially. Nor, it was so clearly widespread the consequences of the "**Quantitative Easing**", the technical term behind such action (or policy.)

* [Paper Money is financial communism](https://robang74.github.io/chatgpt-answered-prompts/html/paper-money-financial-communism-03.html)

Therefore, I decided to challenge the Mistral AI about the content of this article. Supporting its analysis with some other well-known sources of information.

I chose Mistral AI because at that time, and it still is, it was the most advanced AI technology suitable for being leveraged as critical peer-reviewing. In fact, it takes its name from the concept of "mixture of experts" in which several (8, usually) differently trained (experts) AI models collaboratively compete to provide the best answer to the user prompt.

I think you may be impressed by the chatbot Q&A dialogue and its conclusion, like I was.

## The Fugio cent

> The Fugio cent, also known as the Franklin cent, is the first official circulation coin of the United States. Consisting of 0.36 oz (10 g) of copper and minted dated 1787, by some accounts it was designed by Benjamin Franklin. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugio_cent)

<div align="center"><img class="wbsketch inksave" src="img/278-the-paper-money-is-financial-communism-img-002.png"><br/></div>

In the original Benjamin Franklin draft two mottoes was impressed on the coin:

> `MIND YOUR BUSINESS`

> `WE ARE ONE`

It is reasonable to think that the word "*business*" was intended literally here, as Franklin was an influential and successful businessman. Lately these mottoes were changed in:

> `IN GOD WE TRUST`

> `E PLURIBUS UNUM`

The change of the first motto is quite relevant because it moves the focus from the pragmatic approach to practical things like "*trust in yourself*" or "*work hard to succeed*" to something that can be read as "*good luck matters*" or "*hope rather than preparation*".

Also the change of the second motto is quite relevant because it moves from a plain English written concept that everyone can understand to a Latin motto which means almost the same in origin - out of many, one - or in the Cicero's paraphrase of Pythagoras "*unum fiat ex pluribus*" which means that society is created from the union of many (the People).

The Franklin original version is pure U.S. history while the changes are from Europe, clearly.

However, "*we are one*" is not a concept exclusively European. The same concept has been expressed in many other places, in many different ages and from different cultures. In particular the Sud-African tribes "*Ubuntu*" concept is quite similar in the meaning just. In particular because the cultural gap, sometimes, is so wide that it is difficult to grab all the nuances in the meaning.

Lately, in the post U.S. civil war era, the symbolism clearly evolves towards a kind of mix made of Roman Empire signs and Free-Masonry mottoes or beliefs. Showing quite a contamination compared to the pragmatic and practical culture of those who were colonial people.

## L'estrazione di Maduro e il petrolio

Coloro che festeggiano la caduta del "dittatore" Maduro come "amico di Putin" non sanno che Maduro è caduto proprio perché Russia e Cina hanno tolto il loro supporto al Venezuela. Per capire perché lo abbiano fatto occorre fare un passo indietro.

Durante il G7 in Puglia (Italia) nel 2024 avrebbe dovuto essere rinnovato dopo 50 anni l'accordo sul petrodollaro ma il firmatario ha mandato un telegramma di defezione all'ultimo minuto. Quindi il dollaro americano ha perso l'ultimo collaterale che ne garantiva la credibilità finanziaria, perché in quell'ambiente ormai è tutta una questione di carteggio e anche il carteggio è venuto meno.

Così nel 2026, gli USA si trovano ad affrontare il muro degli interessi sul debito pubblico che ormai viaggia a quota $38T mentre la somma di quello pubblico e privato veleggia per i $110T, sono cifre mostruose se consideriamo che le ferrovie degli USA sono ancora al '900, quasi metà degli USA sono deserto e nonostante consumino più energia di quanto ne producano sono esportatori di GNL. L'energia infatti la producono tramite centrali nucleari con combustibile quasi esclusivamente russo della Rosatom. Infine è una società disintegrata dall'individualismo, dal consumismo e dal Fentanyl.

A questo punto appare chiaro che la Russia preferisce vendere alla Cina e per la Cina il GNL americano è troppo costoso. I rapporti tra Maduro e Putin erano quindi solo fra esportatori di greggio e a quel punto diventa inevitabile l'accordo: cade Maduro, gli USA mettono a collaterale del loro debito pubblico le riserve petrolifere del Venezuela, la Cina compra dalla Russia che non deve più mettere a rischio i trasporti di fronte all'Europa.

Questo però significa che l'Ucraina non è più strategica per gli USA e non lo è nemmeno la sorte del campo di gas naturale di fronte al mar di Gaza affidato alla Eni Italia che è la ragione della crisi del 7 ottobre 2023. Una crisi che avrebbe dovuto avvantaggiare notevolmente la posizione di ENI in quella regione ma si è rivelata un boomerang.

Ergo coloro che festeggiano non hanno compreso il riassetto geopolitico che è intervenuto a partire dal 2022, o meglio dal 2019 (covid), o dal 2013-2015 (Euromaidan, Minsk 1 e 2) o dal 2006-8 (subprime loan, Putin Monaco, NATO Budapest) o dal 2000-2001 (Euro, crisi dotcom, Cina WTO, G8 Genova, USA 9/11) o dal 1991-2 (scioglimento URSS) o dal 1973 (fine accordi Bretton Wood) o dal 1963 (Assasinio JFK) e quindi da quando la finanziarizzazione del dollaro è cominciata.

Il punto di svolta poteva essere la caduta del muro di Berlino (1989) ma già nel 1992 la dottrina Wolfowitz lasciava poche speranze e la fine di Mani Pulite nel 1994 alzò il sipario di quello che era un teatro di intrattenimento nel quale Gheddafi è stato deposto mentre Putin ha messo in discussione l'impianto geopolitico e quindi è diventato nemico della NATO l'anno dopo.

Qual'è la valuta commerciale e di riserva di valore nel mondo?

USD oppure il petrolio? Questo è il nodo centrale di tutto quanto.

Trump ieri ha risposto: il petrolio.

### Poteva essere diverso?

La domanda essenziale che ci si pone sempre di fronte alle svolte della storia -- per coloro che le comprendono perché per gli altri sono notizie eclatanti oggi ma già dimenticate la prossima settimana come è normale che sia perché la memoria umana è intrinsecamente una catena di logos ossia una narrazione ed è su questa base biologica su cui si basa la tragedia di coloro che pensano che controllando la narrativa, quindi la memoria della gente, possano cambiare la realtà quando invece ciò che accade è uno stupore continuo di fronte all'incomprensibile perché una narrativa alienata dalla realtà ovviamente porta a dimenticare ma incapacità sia l'azione nel presente quanto la predizione del futuro che quindi diventa una continua sorpresa sorprendente come scoprire l'acqua calda ogni giorno -- poteva essere diverso?

Dipende da quando ci si pone questa domanda e non è banale, si poteva essero se l'assassinio di JFK fosse fallito come quello di Trump. In quel caso la reazione del presidente americano sarebbe stata molto dura e probabilmente avrebbe avuto successo perché a quel punto appariva ovvio che la determinazione degli antagonisti (america vs america) era assoluta e JFK da parte sua poteva solo riuscire o morire. Quindi si, poteva essere diverso come dimostra la presidenza Trump. Ma è andata diversamente quindi ora siamo nell'era Trump, anno secondo.

Quindi la domanda oggi ha senso porsela nuovamente: poteva essere diverso? Poteva Trump scegliere un'altra strada? No, anzi è stato costretto ad accelerare sul Venesuela proprio per evitare ciò che accadde invece in Ucraina il 24 febbraio 2022 in cui l'operazione speciale che aveva lo scopo di prendere il controllo dell'aeroporto di Kiev per aprire un ponte aereo con il quale prendere Kiev. Un'operazione speciale che fallì, perché le difese Ucraine avevano avuto l'addestramento, le armi, leinformative e tutto il supporto possibile dal 2014 in poi. Quindi erano determinati e pronti, nel 2022.

Dal canto suo la Russia non è fallita sotto lo shock finanziario che avrebbe dovuto drenare liquidità nelle commodity prezzate sul riferimento del prezzo del gas della piazza di Amsterdam che era soggetto ad uno stratagemma che ne faceva salire artificiosamente il prezzo. Come la bolla dei bulbi di Tulipani, all'inizio avrebbe concentrato capitali e poi come un buco nero li avrebbe cancellati. Questo shock di liquidità, insieme alle sanzioni, avrebbero dovuto mettere in ginocchio la Russia o per lo meno questo in estrema sintesi era il piano che invece è andato in mona perché il trucco è stato scoperto.

Al fallimento di questo piano (late 2022), ha fatto seguito la crisi di Gaza (late 2023) ma anche quella è stata un disastro, quindi l'elezione di Trump (late 2024) e già al suo insediamento l'hype dell'AI aveva fatto quello avrebbe dovuto fare il trucco del prezzo del gas: concentrazione di enormi capitali in mano a poche persone: una manciata di CEO che alla fine si sono trovati tutti quanti seduti al tavolo da pranzo con Trump. Perché l'AI non esiste senza energia.

Quindi la sequenza di eventi che ci porta all'insediamento di Trump, già imponeva a Trump determinate scelte: 1. l'AI come driver dell'economia americana perché il boom della costruzione delle infrastrutture e riapertura delle centrali nucleari, il rapporto debito/PIL avrebbe distrutto l'America; 2. l'energia come commodity universale senza la quale nulla è possibile. Il dollaro si stampa come fosse carta igienica, ma senza energia è zero.

Trump ha capito benissimo la situazione e l'ha saputa gestire altrettanto bene. Infatti ha raccolto investimenti e contratti per $3.2T nel 2025 per l'AI dai paesi arabi quindi dagli sceicchi che sono (o meglio erano) anche i signori del petrolio. Nel Mediterraneo, sicuramente lo sono ancora, specialmente dopo la crisi del Mar Rosso. Se l'energia è la commodity universale, la tecnologia è la chiave di volta e in particolare la produzione di chip che però è concentrata a Taiwan, un'isola nello spazio geopolitico cinese la cui sovranità è contestata dalla Cina.

L'egemonia tecnologia e della produzione di Chip lo dimostra bene la curva inflazionistica del costo della memoria RAM che da quando OpenAI si è assicurata preventivamente il 40% della produzione mondiale, è salito del 628%. Cosa simile ha fatto Nvidia sviluppando hardware anche per le backbone dei data center sempre più fantascientifici e si è assicurato per tre anni l'esclusiva sulla produzione di chip per l'inferenza da parte di Groq. Ma è davvero necessario tutto questo hardware? No per l'AI ma lo è per ragioni geopolitiche che ci spiega bene il cambio di strategia di mercato/produzione di Crucial.

Intanto occorre premettere che la divisione mobile di Samsung si è vista negare la fornitura di memoria da parte di Samsung electronics perché conviene vendere RAM per i data center piuttosto che per gli smartphone. Crucial, che ha una posizione di rilievo nel mercato consumer ed è un brand molto apprezzato dai modders, ha fatto una scelta simile: ha deciso di abbandonare il mercato consumer per servire esclusivamente quello datacenter.

Quando questa bolla dell'AI sarà esplosa anche se l'AI come strumento non passerà di moda semplicemente passerà di moda il modello inflazionistico attuale. Succederanno diverse cose: 1. ci saranno centri di calcolo sotto utilizzati quindi cloud a basso costo ma in un mondo nel quale anche il paradigma dei dati come nuovo petrolio sarà superato; 2. ci saranno centrali nucleari sotto-utilizzate ma già pagate che però potranno andare a supplire la domanda dell'auto elettrica, specialmente in america perché in Europa ci meniamo il belino a turbine e pannelli solari (almeno a sentir parlare i media); 3. l'industria del chip collasserà.

Il terzo punto è quello centrale. Il costo dei chip deve salire a dismisura per convincere le aziende a costruire fonderie altrove che a Taiwan. Perché piaccia o meno, Taiwan è persa come e anche più della marina americana nel Mar Rosso. Quindi l'estrazione di Maduro non è la conquista del Venezuela, ma la rimozione dalla carica di presidente di un paese devastato, con inflazione e povertà da terzo mondo, e con divisioni interne feroci. Maduro è stato estratto con più difficoltà di quanto Trump non ne abbia avuto a comprarsi l'elezione di questo Pontefice ma conquistare il Venezuela e quindi porre sotto il controllo americane le loro riserve petrolifere e con esse consolidare il debito pubblico americano è tutt'altra storia. Il Vietnam dovrebbe ricordare qualcosa agli americani a riguardo.

Quindi la risposta di Trump è stata chiara: l'energia è la commodity universale ossia la moneta del mondo, il resto sono carteggi su CHI controlla l'energia. Dalla parte opposta c'è l'opposto della "commodity" che in economia si chiama "scarcity" che è la tecnologia, attualmente declinata come chip. Perché nell'economia solo ciò che é materiale quindi ha un elemento intrinseche di finitezza è reale. Detto in altre parole se l'energia è il fondamentale abilitante, mentre il chip sono i mezzi di produzione del valore aggiunto che bisogna produrre altrove che a Taiwan e in questo contesto pare che Singapore in tandem con la Malesia sia in pole-position.

Singapore perché da ex-colonia britannica è un paese in common-law e con un altissimo tenore di vita ma piccolo, pertanto come potrebbe essere il Liechtenstein è ottimo per la gestione dell'IP dei chip. Mentre la Malesia è la concorrente povera di Taiwan o meglio è la Taiwan prima dei chip: costi di impianto e manodopera bassissimi. Perché oggi come agli inizi del '900 quello che muove tutto nell'industria è il differenziale fra costo di produzione e prezzo di vendita. Anche quando si tratta di produzione strategica, quello è il determinante. Non stupisce quindi che la finanziarizzazione sia una malattia mentale profondamente radicata negli occidentali.

Quindi gli americani giocano una partita in cui l'Ucraina è persa, ma anche Taiwan è persa. Perciò Trump punta a mettere le riserve petrolifere del Venezuela a collaterale del dollaro. Ossia, in termini pratici, fare in modo che sia il Venezuela a pagare per gli americani. Però conquistare il Venezuela non sarà facile come lo è stato conquistare il Vaticano. Non sarà facile come è stato convincere gli Arabi ad investire nell'AI, salvo poi scoprire che gli ultimi 18 mesi di progressi negli LLM sono fuffa, per l'80-90%. Non sarà facile come mettere Netanyahu e gli UK nella merda.

Se il Venezuela sarà un altro Vietnam, la produzione dei chip la faranno i messicani dopo essersi presi la California, non ideologicamente come i democratici americani si sono presi l'Europa corrompendo l'élite a Bruxelles. No, intendo proprio che la California ritornerà al Messico e i saranno i messicani a fare anche i chip quindi il futuro dell'informatica potrebbe parlare messicano, non più inglese. Oggi, uno scenario del genere sembra follia o fantascienza. Non è detto che accada, tante cose sono in ballo e troppe per essere certi di qualcosa in particolare. Ma è uno scenario concretamente possibile. Come si usa dire nella meccanica quantistica, è una canale aperto e non solo accessibile mediante effetto tunnel.

Quindi Taiwan è perduta -- amen -- dove è quell'altrove dove si faranno i chip?

Questa è la domanda essenziale odierna, the day after l'estrazione di Maduro.

Per quanto riguarda invece i rimbambiti che ho incitato alla frode e al furto [qui](https://www.facebook.com/roberto.a.foglietta/posts/10162772987683736) (e trascrizione [qui](data/l-imposta-sul-bollo-cc-li-tocco-piano.txt#?target=_blank)) per loro la storia è già terminata, e se qualcosa hanno preso, sono quattro spicci o più probabilmente promesse vane, in cambio di levarsi dal fare rumore. Per caprie l'insignificanza geopolitica di quella gente è relativo "network di business" come chiamano il marketing della narrazione tossica anti-realtà, è bastato il profilo LinkedIn collegato ad una fanciulla ossessionata dai cani randagi in una lontana provincia dell'impero burocratico d'Europa. Giusto per dire quanto sia banale oggi giorno fare la qualsiasi cosa in Europa e invece una spina nel fianco affrontare gli Houthi nel Mar Rosso.

Il che ci porta a pensare che probabilmente il dualismo energia-chip non sia tutto.
