## Such a man of Common Sense!

The following is the 1st gut-written draft edition, enjoy while I am working to better shape it into a document.

### It is not about your opinion

In these days I saw few videos about a the anti-system candidate running for Canada presidency. A matter that I do not care about because I am not feeling involved even by a little measure of it. 

However, because I recognised that some statements in such electoral campaign have some sort of implications (spoiler: the candidate has been suggested to present itself as an anti-system candidate that it would fix the anti-reality system using the common sense) about a topic of many that I am interested in, I care to talk about THAT topic.

### A premise, necessarily

Before arguing about the opinions expressed in that videos, I wish to clarify a point even better two of them:

1. if you are deeply involved in politics and you strongly believe that politics is “everything that matters” then everything I can say is a political statement even if I say that sky is blue and grass is green;

2. if you have been educated in such manner to believe that your god is the truth and others people gods are fake, then it irrelevant asking me if I believe in god rather than asking me to agree with you.

Again, the second is just a vicious way to implement the first point as “religion is everything that matters” and deciding to argue with me (or whoever other) from that point of view. Let me complete this scenario with the following:

3. finance is a religion because is supposed we believe in something without checking about facts and without any degree of freedom in arguing about that but “in god we trust” printed on $1 banknote.

In short - whatever it matters for you – I am not arguing about it, but I am doing that old-fashioned border line human activity to find out a **description of reality** that works or works better than **your** unfactual opinion.

Please, notice that `F=ma` the Newton first law of the Classic Mechanics cannot be assessed not even discovered or falsified in a democratic way nor by consensus. Despite this as much as the speed reach a small fraction of the light speed, that law starts to lose its grip on the reality and hence reality is starting to “works” outside our comprehension while reality maintains a full grip on us.

This is a **very important** premise because in front of a statement like “I believe in Thor being true god, and because of this I am protected by being lightening struck” or anything similar, I will never argue with you about Thor but suggesting you to prove your point in standing still on a mountain peak raising at the sky a long and sharply pointing conductive metal rod.

Most probably your “religion” will forbid that “obscene” way of acting otherwise people would experienced a factual proof of being wrong. It happens the same with finance, and here we are.

A specific example of this premise concept can be found in (a) “Sei tu il problema, non l’AI” and in a broader manner within the vast universe of the fantasy literature section -- which like the Dante’s Hell can be entitled engraving the following statement “opinions vs reality: drop every hope you dare to get in here” above the entering door -- we can count in also (b) “I wish to be a wolf, please accept it” or (c) “The variety vs diversity, and other fairy tales about X/XY chromosomes issue”.


### Who is the target reader

Not all the documents are written for everybody. This document is going to argument about **finance** - check an etymologic wise dictionary without giving for assessed your definition of that word, please - and for who matters reasoning in a rational and reality-functioning way.

The starting point is some declaration of a supposedly anti-system candidate for Canadian presidency which is sponsored by the suggestion that he can fix a broken system at its fundamentals using the common sense.

Which is functional to sustain the pro status-quo because once he will got in charge, he will necessarily became part of the system he likes to change. Which is like to say: I play at the blackjack table because I can bet the Casino by my skills. Sure!

Moreover, by definition, the Common Sense works when common {concept, activities, topic, etc. } are at the stake. Trying to walk on the Moon using the `F=ma` first law of Classical Mechanics will lead in such a great disaster that Apollo 13 mission were a great achievement in comparison.

In this scenario we have to face with people who firmly believe that an infinitely inflationary fiat currency can fuel a financial system that can cope in a proper way of dealing with a global economy - check an etymologic wise dictionary without giving for assessed your definition of that word, please – in which material goods and production are limited while natural resources are consumed much faster their rate of renovation.

By the way, it is not about believing in WHAT but about questioning ourselves about WHY and trying to provide us with a rational thinking achieved answer that can withstand facts and can be functional in dealing with reality.

The evil root of the nowadays issues is written in books – not in stone – written by people which has pretty no any knowledge of the subsect because at that time no one has and for this reason won the honour to be the founding fathers of that topic (like Adam Smith, just for naming the most famous author of that time).

For sake of fairness, those who wrote the critics (e.g. Karl Marx, just to naming the author most secretly read among those who live betting others people wealth at the Wall Street Casino) of the system based on their early funding fathers philosophy – *while the concepts of economics and accounting were existing millennials before the branch of studies about such a topic like finance and economic were never formalised also because the University itself was invented few centuries before and took its time to spread around the Europe* – were in the same pot cooking aka poorly educated about the subject with no any real-world experience – *also because the Industrial Revolution was at its first beginnings hence nobody at that time could have matured any kind of real-world experience on which base its scientific consideration, therefore just philosophy can be written at that time* – and both were educated and widely experienced in a manner that compared with the nowadays state-of-art on that subjects (including chaos, systems and games theories without forgetting the Nash equilibrium principle or the falsification of asymmetric information advantage, etc.) make look like them as a bunch of untouched tribe of savages who lived all their life-time like monkeys in the jungle.

Or to make a more shorter but still fashionable example, we can states that accepting paper money which has printed by thin air (aka legal currency without a material back-up or any fixed rate with a valuable commodity, aka golden standard or Bretton Wood agreement)  in exchange of our proprieties, work and preciously limited life-time is something that makes – *in comparison* – the Native Americans - *who were trading their hunting [prede] in exchange for “the water made of fire” whiskey, get intoxicated and [drogati dipendenti] for having more* - seems them like an exclusive club of illuminati doing a great business richly profitable.

Just in case the previous explanation was too convoluted and historically richly based, compared the example above, to be got quickly. At this time, the idea that you still not got a clue but still reading is quite fascinating. Which is the reason because Casino has no any clock displaying the time on the walls, nor windows to check outside and not even a easy way to get out plus some of them also offering free drink, foods and accommodation in hotel, just in case you feel lucky.

The same with this paper, it is comfortable for me to be not excessively crystal clear but artisanely convoluted in crafting this piece of literature. Just because I am not in a peculiar urgency to check by person about the afterlife. I prefer to send many more in front of me, even if no one of them returned yet to tell us about it. Yes, it is dark humour and thanks for having noticed it.

### The gun has the safe

The most Common Sense convincing opinion explained by that candidate can be summarised as in the following:

> The previous president and its government increased the public debt as much as all the others governments we had before in the history of our country. Moreover the monetary mass created by this way of doing enlarged by multiple times the production. Something like +60% vs +4%. I will cure the system adopting the Common Sense rule of not doing that any more but enforcing the public servants to follow the concept of a finite system resources.

Whatever, let me just pointing out few details:

- common sense works beautiful for common situations but currently the clothes drying machines in USA and also in Canada are sold with manuals which states “not suitable for pets” hence we can agree that the “common sense” is not such common as we lovely think

- and moreover, the common sense is very limited in time forecasting also. Providing an example which fit this case: as soon as the candidate will be the new president in charge, his living and health will be strongly under the control of anyone who is part of the system that he wish to reform with his opinion

- the candidate opinion is not his opinion but the silly idea of an Italian university professor of Economics that wonder to win a Nobel prize for having saved a rootly-rotten system by itself – another [segretamente] drag queen which is going to make as much damage as the dynamite invented by Nobel – mixing the idea that “words alone” (aka fairy tales) can change reality when used in politics because consensus can achieve miracles (aka stupidity is supposedly unlimited, but in doing disasters not in doing good). I know because I am the one who triggered that insane personality to act as he is acting

- which gave me the chance to wrote this piece of literature for hopefully the posterity whatever they will be human or anything else survived to our madness or who will evolves or arrives after our “happy ending”.
However, even supposing to have addressed all of these properly let me highlight few but relevant points:

- in short, common sense is limited and not so common as we wish

- the current politician can convince and even enforce a policy, but what’s about the next?

- crashing the system and then cure it, are both good complementary way to suck our life out of us

- any financial system based on infinite inflationary fiat currency is doomed to drive our economics to its worst possible ending: the whole humanity extinction or our civilisation collapse, whatever you may consider the worst among the two, I still vote for the Asteroid.

- despite the Asteroid is the quickest solution for our all problems, we may aim in finding something less scenographic and – unfortunately or fortunately for us  – the only way to let a financial system properly operates as a complementary sibling for a real-world finite economics is to embedded a limited resources paradigms at its foundation.

- printing (or not printing, cit. Hamlet) more money that product growth is NOT the point as much as giving a gun with the barrel ready in the chamber but the safe lock and supposing that the kid will not shoot us because s/he will not unlock and pull the trigger.

### What’s about the product?

Last but not least

- the “product” but **WHAT** for the Hell product we are speaking about?

Sure, the Gross Domestic Product, which by its own definition collected all the transactions  without any other kind of accountability which means without any chance to eventually differentiate waste from product.

The Baltimore Bridge collapsed and it is pretty clear also because common sense that it was a disaster, a damage, and its destruction was a minus not a plus on a road of a wealthy country.

Despite this crystal clear evidence, the US gross domestic product increased because repairing the damage even if it costed 10x times more than a proper maintenance plan combined with an “everyday a bit” safety updating policy.

Moreover, when your preferred Starbucks Latte or Cappuccino raises its price from $1 to $7, also those transaction were going to inflate the GDP, not because common sense but because Math.

Finally, always that f*cking hard to learn Math, says that considering GDP inflation as “production” increase and by that increase also increase the monetary mass (aka a quantitative easing step froward, or a “whatever we takes, f*ck you all” expansive monetary policy by central banks) hence increasing the public debt maintains the ratio between debt/production stable while we are striving more in living in a progressive state of poverty because prices goes up but not our salaries.

Unless, that Canadian presidency candidate would not consider to raises the payrolls like Putin did for more than 20 years  and in an exceptional measure immediately after the Ukrainian Crises started to being decided on the war front lines in 2022.

In such a case, it is useful to remember that raising payroll makes people happy, boost economy thus increase the GDP “production”, creates inflation anyway and achieve the same “happy ending humanity or Western civilisation” result but with the happy word coherently set.

- For a minute we made our investors happy (or alternatively our working class happy).

Citing the man in the cave telling the goodnight fairy tale to new-savages era post financial communism – yes, paper money is financial communism because, trough a fiat currency finally Adam Smith and Karl Marx philosophies converged into the same real-word scenario in which the worst ever form of Communism combined with an as harsh can be the common-sense dictatorship (aka mediaocracy) attitude in replacing an arbitrary ethical or moral ideology, their final destination is pretty the same, exactly the same  – usually depicted as meme on social networks because the Plato’s cave concept of common-sense lack of foresight is too cultural to get a grasp on people.

### Considerations

It is hard to imagine how the posterity will classify this period of our history in which some people gains an astonishing deeply understanding of an amusing large and diversified collection of notions learning how to deal with all that immense stuff by digital technology and computers, while others are still worshipping like deity people who moved their first step in that knowledge area in the 1800.

* [Dietro a quel nome c'è un modo](298-dietro-a-quel-nome-c-e-un-mondo.md) - an Italian 1st draft document, posted recently of Facebook still in raw format. 

Something that can be dismantled by someone who carry on sheltering and breeding 10 milking cows in some remote part of the world.

## Conclusion

Printing money by thin air is bad - extremely bad - but every central banks and related governments do that because all the others are doing that. Greed is good at its best of competitiveness in a challenge that we cannot afford to lose, whatever it takes. It is the epitaph of the Western civilization or human race on this planet. I vote for the 2nd option and I vote for the Asteroid.

Those are not agree with that, may find interesting evaluating this new finite resources constrained financial and monetary system. [link]

Because as a supporter of the Asteroid-oriented solution by a scientific factual PoV, it is necessary to provide a viable, rational and functional solution otherwise “false myth” were as good as others “false myth” and there were not a way-out. Nope!

The Asteroid should be a free-will choice for the Western civilisation or the whole humanity, they should have their own chance to chose for the best but voted for the Asteroid, instead.

That’s f*cking apple hanging on from that tree branch were the speaking snake was promoting it as a delicious opportunity to earn something for free like printing money from thin air, do you remember… It is a choice, an everyday choice, not a single on-time-once mistake.

Never change our own mind is a strong sign of faith in the benevolence that reality will not present the bill to us because we shared with a vast consensus our unfactual believes with many others and therefore we should be absolved all together.

Even people who were not aware about what the Sun does or where it goes when the night come wrote the opposite about. Think all the time you need about it, but not too much!
