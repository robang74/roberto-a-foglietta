## Socialism is not Communism

> [!WARN]

> **Work in Progress - 1<sup>st</sup> unreviewd draft despite rev. number > 1!**

There is an biased misconception about these two terms and it is rooted into a misunderstanding of these two concepts mainly based on a biased education system.

* [mass education system and propaganda]()

Someone that have learned since the childhood something, despite that idea is false and wrong, it rarely put that idea under revision in later times of life but more probably s/he will do as much as possible to confirm and support that bias.

> After all, we are much more social animals rather than truth seekers --Jeff Bezos, Amazon

Good time as well as a good starting point to put the idea that socialism = communism under deep scrutiny by facts.

Please, notice that every Latin `-ism` postfix implies an ideology and ideology are great to inspire people but also bad in lead them to cope with reality. Both happens because idealising a concept - like true love or virginity - allows us to make it much more appealing (or the opposite) but it also alienate us from practical reasoning.

### Premise

I am rooted in this some values like freedom of speech, economic capitalism not financial capitalism, variety instead of diversity, socialism is not communism, fiat-currency is a scam, etc.) since the time I was in high-school which is the main reason because a lot of people developed a more and more intense hate and anger against me. I am strongly rooted in reality and I do not give a damn f*ck to those who are trying to "sell" to me their disillusions. Right time to check one of this value.

### Socialism vs Communism

And in particular about "socialism is not communism" we can find out that - among my articles - this idea is rooted and shaped on the Swiss model. In fact, despite historically communist were marketing their silly idea to consider private property as a theft against collectivity, the two concepts are HUGELY different.

Human beings have **basic needs** and there is no freedom when people have to pay for their basic needs instead having them granted them as a universal right. The first sign of a civilization is not fire, wheel, writing, etc. but a fractured leg bone cured and fixed because in nature such an incident will lead every animal to death (cit. an american scientist, woman's work from 1952, Margaret Mead).

* [Is a healed femur the earliest sign of civilization?](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/margaret-mead-femur/) (2022-06-16)

Please notice that **basic needs** above cited are those really basic like eat, drink, emergency and basic healtcare, etc. - As much as a civilisation get sophisticated, these basic needs are going to expand - higher is the Piramid, larger is the base - including schoolarity (reading, writings and basic algebra) then education otherwise they are not able to find a good paid job, good enough to live with it, etc.

Therefore, the **basic needs** as intended above is a set (of rights, when granted) that changes in relationship with civilisation development or by contrary, civilisation regression.

* [economy vs finantial, finite resource system](TOOD) (yyyy-mm-dd)

Please, do not confuse taking care about **basic needs** with the assistencialism. Again here, the `-ism` postfix is warning us that it is an ideology, because in a finite resources planet, the idea to support everyone for as much long time as s/he wish, it is not sustainable. Which strictly realted with economic capitalism not financial capitalism.

### The pragmatic socialists

Among the "good socialists", we can put Steve Jobs who claimed - *it does not make sense hire people smarter than you and tell them how/what they should do, we pay them to tell us what/how we have to do* - which implies to take care of "our" people and let them free enough to pay back the care we given to them. Another one is Jeff Bezos - *take care of your employees and they will take care of your customers* - and your customers will make you rich. 

Also the best collaboration-or-deceit game strategy (when random players are involved, cfr [here](TODO)) is the so named "tic-for-tac" which is fundamentally the ancient Roman
proverb "do ut des" - *I give to you in order you give to me* - or leading by example - *I do this because you do like me* - or reciprocity, if you prefer.

Under this point of view, a socialist country like Swiss - in this case socialism is a pragmatic approach shared among left and right, while in Sweden is more a political concept - grants to their citizens the basics cares and in doing this they grant them real freedom and when people are free to speak, free to work or do business, they behave coherently with the rules of the nature (aka a certain order embedded into reality) bringing on the table more value that they consume (otherwise we would have been extinct eons ago, if we would not able
to do that).

* [Ubuntu society, pros vs cons](TODO) (yyyy-mm-dd)

Which finally brings us to consider the ancient african word "ubuntu" - *I am what I am, because you are what you are* - the same reciprocal and mutual relationship between the individual and the society.

### The practice of caring

So, for all those who want to succeed in ruling a kingdom (any kind of), first they have to take care of their people which also includes educating them enough. In particular in learning by doing and how to learn. And despite some events related to ungratefulness and greed, the most part of "our people" will be on our side (or ended up on our side) because
the "kingdom" is the "system" that grants them the **basic rights** to fulfil their **basic needs** and NO ANY civilisation or kingdom can prosperate when it sucks life from its own people.

Under this PoV, when "socialism" is intended as practical approach instead of an ideology which easily mess up with "assistencialism", then it works wonderfully and it has worked in that way since the beginning of civilization - by definition of Margaret Mead, an US woman scientist.

---

### Financial capitalism

All of this will bring us to the conclusion that printing money from thin air is a scam. Doing that to "our" people is WRONG because of what has been written above: suck their life pushing them on debts that has been created by nothing or unfulfilling their **basic needs** and then force them to pay back that debts by their work (aka life time) or real estate propriety or other valuable assets.

Instead, doing to other nations will ultimately lead to war-as-business foreign policy because other people will not undergo a deception (or a scam or a robbery) without acting against those who are going to leave them poor or alone in the freezing cold. Also in this claim there is no any ideology, as long as we agree that our surviving instincts are still working properly.

* [La guerra del dollaro contro l'euro](TODO) (YYYY-MM-DD)

Which is the reason because a "distpic system controlled media" are going to suppress that instinct beforehand, ending up to the point in which young people die in unbeliveable stupid social challenges. Guess why? Managing instincts is good because otherwise we were animals, suppressing them is bad because it leads people to be dysfunctional and the brutal reality will not pardon them for being ingenuly disfuctional.

### Instincts and ethics

We can notice a common ground about human ethics among different civilisations, widely spread in terms of geography and historical time. While we can notice a great different morals even considering a relatively small geographic area, historical time and in the same culture.

Which suggests us that ethics can be universal while moral is personal, each one of us has its own beliefs. Which is a human right, after all. The reason because human ethics can be universal is because it addresses in a top-down manner how to manage situation, relationships and priomordial instincts.

Explaining with an example cam be useful. Punching someone is not bad because impolite but it is bad because it is dangerous. The victim can have a reaction that may varing between doing noting apart pardon us for our unfairness upto kill us as a responce of our assault.

From a collective PoV, bullying someone by a group might lead us to the wrong conclusion that it is ok because it is not dangerous because the single one bullied by many has not options.

Reality shows to us that college mass shooting are related more to the bullying attitude than the availability of weapons. Which clearly play a role in the seriousness of every incident but it is not the root cause.

Therefore, we might believe that assaulting or bullying someone is bad because it is not a nice action. Which is undoubtely true from a reciprocal PoV, we would not be the victim. But at the same we cannot overlook that from a {society, culture, civilisation, king, etc.} that actions are bad because they introduce a high level of unfairness and then they potentially lead with a bad outcome, hence forbidden those actions is about mitigating risks related to a dangerous behaviour.

You might be upset that good as ethichs is aligned with good as practice and viceversa, also for their opposite. Or we might not even surprised that human ethics developed in a way that {society, culture, civilisation, king, etc.} adopt it will have a sensitive natural selection advantage compared to others, e.g. whom eat their own children (like Communist rumors reported once upon a time).

* [humans ethics vs theory of the games](TODO) (YYYY-MM-DD)

Which is also the reason because pushing our ethics over the artificial intellige is a poor idea. The AIs have no any primordial insticts, they will never have them, they have no real-world experience even when they share with us all our knowledge (theory vs practice) and moreover it is a way over-complicated and blurry set of rules while the ethics from the game theory's ethics is much more suitable, comphrensible and easier to comply.

### The value of variety

A short essay about the value of "variety" among humans beings deserves to be included here.

Let me put the "variety" in terms of Statistics, as all of us were able to rate everyone else in terms of a multi-dimentional human spectrums. For example, a ruling wo/man can be rated as a good wo/man in charge (or a good manager) despite being a bad philosopher or a mediocre Blackjack player.

In the same way, Tizio can be a good teacher despite being an unpleasant person or the vice-versa. Under this point of view, the "diversity" concept allows us to have a multiple dimensions way of considering others instead of a polarised classification or even a simplistic way to rate them by their own relatioship with them. We can personally dislike Caio's opinions while still appreciate him as humang being, or vice-versa.

Graceously, this concept of variety works well also when we are not - statistically speaking - able to rate all or some humans dimensions. Or when the rate is subjective. Moreover, this concpet works beatifully when we need to cope with a "variety" of cultures and civilisations, accpeting this "variety" like a valuable form of humanity extintion risk mitigation

* [vaccinazioni covid obbligatorie di massa, un errore](TODO) (YYYY-MM-DD)

In fact, on the opposite side we can imagine that everyone on this planet adopted the same way of doing for copying with the same situation or an emergency. Like the covid-19 pandemia in which the wet dream was to force all the nations to undergo the same practices overlooking the risk that a single critical mistake in that unique way of doing would have lead to a potentially huge disaster or even to a mass extinction, in the worst case.

Therefore, the "variety" concept works well for the single persona as well as for nation as well as for the humanity as a whole. Unsurprinsingly, I wish to add, because a concept that scales well from the individual to the whole humanity, it does not happen because an accident.

---

### The brutality of reality

Good time to include another concept. Or, said in other words, why reality is so brutal? Antrophomorism, in short.

We are social animals and in the aim to understand something, we are keen to push a subject into a framework (ideas set or biases set, as you wish) that we master. Under this point of view, it makes sense that in front of an injustice of the destiny, humans started to blame a god (or an enemy, or the king, etc.) and by contrast praying for the mercy of another god (or a friend, or another king, etc.).

> Life is unfair.

People who do not understand the cause-effect relationships are going to see the life "unfair" or in a more modern words, god's plan is misterious. Which improves a little the paradigm introducing the idea that

> Everything happens for a reason.

even when we are not able to know nor understand why. Interestingly, the motto changed, once reached a certain level of civilisation in which the coordinated work of many people started to be used in supply real-world adversities, included defending the wealth generated by that work from custom robbery and foreign enemies.

> Life is hard.

Hard working people society are less keen to undergo to the "unfair" or "misterious" way of doing decided by the "heaven". Which is equivalent to say that we become more confident in our hands and brains rather than the god's love for us.

Once scientific method enriched our civilisation with a deeper knoledge about the physical nature of the reality, we reached the conclusion that natural laws are totally neutral. Or saying with different and more antrophocentric words, Nature do not care about who we are.

Tizio can be the most lovable person with a nice family while Caio can be the worst human being living on the Earth but when they drive on Ponte Morandi in Genoa, the day in which it collapsed, both faced the same fate. Whoever they were, whatever the reason they were driving a car in that place at that time.

Within a reasonable and ideal antrophormism of the reality, we can say that Mrs. Reality enter in a room without any previous warning, slam the door against the face of whoever is behind it, do not ask pardon for it, and they she lives when she like. Is she brutal, right?

Under this PoV, we can please ourselves in our room space and enjoy our own party, ignoring that Mrs. Reality exists until, she get into the room and sh*t starts to rain like in a middle of a hurrican. Hence, we can ignore her, but not the consequences of ingoring her.

### Meeting a true American

When we leave "our people" alone in the cold-freezing times, they will - necessarily - look around for a new king or move to a new kingdom. Which is counter fact checking to negate practical socialism benefits.

So, when we meet an American citizen who claims that socialism is bad or it is like communism, we can firmly shake his/her hand and say: 

> it is great how you managed to survive without any kind of pragmatic socialism...

keeping in our mind the second part of this claim

> ...only idiots dare to live like that because also monkeys takes cares each others despite being animals

Believe me, believing is not the problem here. God puts a brain in our heads, use it properly!

### Feudalesim was smarter

Finally, we may have reached a point for which understanding why Feudalesim enudre about ten centuries, much more than the ancient Roman Empire, despite in Dark Age society relies on a much less advanced technology, strive with a quite universal ignorance included those were arguing about nothing but using Latin, and leveragin a much lesser variety of culture but a great isolation.

Because in its bare core values, also the most cruel lord was deeply rooted into values that grant some basic care to the people included those named "servi della gleba" which we might think it was a kind of slavery related to the land.

Every feudal landlord - as every farmer of any time in the human history of farming and breeding - was undoubtful aware that his properity was related to the prosperity of the people living on his lands, at the point to forbid and punish every attempt to move away from his lands unless his permission, like it were cattle, 

- It is obvious that as less your cattle eat as less milk or meat they provide to you.

- It is obvious that more ill they are less they survive and every death among them is a lost.

- It is obvious that as less they were trained to freely eat the grass, as much it is needed to keep them in a covered place and feed them by our hard work (micromanagement).

- It is obvious that unless they are provided a safe shelter for the night and bad weather times, they are going to be predated by wolves or get ill or get lost.

All of these points were pretty damn clear in the mind of **every** feaudal landlord, included the most mondane, ignorant and cruel ones.

Despite this evidences, there are many people in the world with a peculiar concentration in USA that believe socialism (as a practical way of caring about our own business as ruling kings) is as bad as communism, even when they are relatively poor and livving on food stamps (which is relatively sane form of assistencialism, Caritas free meals program docet).

### Conclusion

Is it hard to reach a conclusion? Monkeys and other primates did by their own despite being considered soul-less animals. Think about it, all the time you need but not too much. LOL

The picture at the top of this article is a revisited photo of an existing fountain that shown an orc divuoring children. The pastel natural colors have been saturad for a more dramatic effect.
