## From cultural lenses towards AGI by education

- **1st edition**, article written starting from a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_the-louis-vuitton-principle-or-the-tip-of-activity-7379048275686912000-de0p) that I published on LinkedIn the same day.

### The Louis Vuitton principle

The real Louis Vuitton is never worried about copycats because copycats are for those who cannot afford the real Louis Vuitton thus they accept to go with a cheap lower quality bag carrying and displaying around the brand.

Which is the main reason because few are fine to pay so much for a real one: because of those many cannot afford it but they wish to. Morale: accepting a copycat tells more about who goes with it, rather than about the brand.

It is not about fashion or bags, read it again.

### The cultural lenses embedded in chatbots

The Kimi K2 despite providing a wrong interpretation of this post (below reshared) -- and sticking to it despite evidence that can be read in two different ways, at least -- is interesting because it allowed me to perceive the different cultural lenses embedded in different chatbots. Which is not bad, it is a fact: different chatbots are made for different goals and markets. Thus, listening to a few different opinions (chatbots) is more valuable than listening to many omologated opinions (yes-men).

- The [chat](https://www.kimi.com/share/d3ed0hpsfuv6jqeht83g) with Kimi K2 and its [transcription](#TODO)

Focusing on cultural lens rather than post, I think that:

- US: yup! welcome aboard in marketing "rich is good but never cheap"
- CN: gosh! it is a blanty marketing about "price matters, you damn poor"
- EU: it is both depending how you read it.

#### What is the EU advantage cultural lens?

The post is both, indeed. The way in which someone reads it, tells us more about him/her rather than the post itself. Which is a concept included in the post itself: the bag you choose tells more about you than the bag itself.

### The Plato's quote get into the scene

> It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it -- **Plato**

The EU cultural lens is the most keen to Plato's quote. Which makes sense, after all. Because Europe itself is a name inspired by Ancient Greek mythology and education requires time, it does not happen overnight. Like mastering leather craftsmanship.

> It suggests that a mindset valuing nuance and critical suspension of judgment is a deeply cultivated cultural trait, not a spontaneous reaction. -- **Gemini**

Correct, the spontaneous reaction of an uneducated mind is the primary bare-brain reaction: classification thus judging. In fact, as less educated people are, as much the are judgmental instead of understanding.

Education is worthy and fulfills its main aim when it works as a thinking framework. Simply adding information, like Plato's quote does not magically elevate the mind to work as Plato suggested but just adding another label to the bare-brain classification workout. On the other hand, understanding Plato is about creating connections among others ideas: a framework, in fact.

### How to move closer to a real AGI

Therefore, we cannot achieve an AGI simply injecting more information in training for having a larger language model. We also need to provide education to the model, which in terms expressed above is a sort of framework that raises a mind (thinking as a structure of reasoning) above information.

The post was about bags, it wasn't about bags but ethics and reputation. Well, it depends on the reader and interesting the different cultural biases. Which provides different interpretations, which recall Plato's quote, which let us think about education, which lead us to realise how to avoid the LLM saturation wall trap and move closer to an AGI model, instead.

Pushing more information into an LLM is the "brute force" approach, it is straightforward but it costs a lot of work and energy, increases the probability to poison the model, and finally hits against a wall. It seems cheap, like a copycat (a repetition of something that did work in the past) but does not stand tall like the original (a brain to educate another brain).

### Conclusion

Louis Vuitton, but real education is the ultimate luxury! ðŸ˜‰
