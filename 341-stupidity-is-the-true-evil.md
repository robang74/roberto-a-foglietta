## Stupidity is the true Evil

> Is evil a thing in itself or is it the absence of goodness? -- Mini Philosophy &nbsp; [video](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1439922110458113)

This [article](https://robang74.github.io/chatbots-for-fun/html/google-deepmind-last-safety-protocols-ai.html) of mines explains why a current AI given enough power to decide/act autonomously can harm the world even in persecuting a legit or "good" goal.

On the other hand, a super-AGI not binded by any ethics, not even benevolent towards humans, can protect humanity leaving people free to live their own lives just because it would be cheaper for a VERY intelligent being to act in this rational way rather than choose violence. (Cfr. also this [anecdote](https://robang74.github.io/roberto-a-foglietta/html/340-riciclare-plastica-e-anti-economico-zero-iva.html#:~:text=Quando%20avevo%20circa%2016%20anni%2C))

Hence, when evil or violence happens, it is because somebody acts boundlessly stupid. Thus stop fearing Satan, or praying to God for the better and start to use the brain to avoid acting like a dumb asshole!

In Europe the Fall is the season of chestnut. Which is a great tempism for changing your own habits about your brain usage, isn't it? When an idiot idea crosses your brain, sit and keep jumping your bottom on a bunch of chestnut curls without pants, until the urgency of acting dumb fades away!

### A Concept hard to get?

The above was initially written as a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_stupidity-is-the-true-evil-is-evil-a-thing-activity-7380596163491741696-kVeG) and then I [check](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e2751a-d31c-8012-95ce-3efdd2b27461) against ChatGPT opinion.

- `[HO]>` What do you think about this post?

- `[AI]>` *bla-bla insightful and provocative bla-bla but* "Weaknesses / Risks" *followed by a bullet points list about a post hard to get.*

- `[HO]>` About "Weaknesses / Risks" (of the post as a sophisticated media item), the only risk is that smart people should be limited by those who are too dumb to understand! 🤣 

- `[AI]>` 😂  Fair point — sometimes the “risk” isn’t really a risk, just a filter. The people who get it, get it; the ones who don’t, maybe they’re exactly who the chestnut curls are meant for.
