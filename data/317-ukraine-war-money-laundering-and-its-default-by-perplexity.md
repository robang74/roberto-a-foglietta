# Nearly 100 accountants in suits and ties landed in Kiev to begin a large-scale audit -- an audit -- of the use of American aid.

And that this is not a courtesy visit is shown by the fact that the American State Department and the Treasury have booked the rooms in a Kiev luxury hotel for a whole month!

Foreign Minister Rubio made it clear that the US wants to see a justification "for every cent that we have transferred from taxpayers' money", and it is of course only pure coincidence that exactly yesterday at the Romanian border the first member of the kleptocrat class who wanted to leave Kleptocratistan for Europe was arrested.

Now, of course, nothing happens by chance in the international big stage, and the fact that after three years of war and hundreds of billions of sunk and burned taxes in this corruption, a whole company of accountants from the USA is now landing in Kiev, of course, is no coincidence either

The arrival of nearly 100 accountants in Kiev to audit the use of American aid, the month-long booking at a luxury hotel by the U.S. State Department and Treasury, Rubio's demand for justification of every cent spent, and the arrest of a member of the "kleptocrat class" at the Romanian border are likely interconnected events suggesting increased scrutiny of how U.S. aid is being utilized in Ukraine.

# When the 100 accountant arrival in Kiev happened?, and when  the "kleptocrat class" at the Romanian border happened? Can you provide a reliable news source for both the events?

The arrival of U.S. inspectors general in Kyiv happened on January 29, 2023[^2_2]. The Accounting Chamber of Ukraine, with U.S. support, also organized two audits of American financial aid, with 25 auditors trained in July 2023[^2_1].

Regarding the arrest of individuals linked to a Russian-backed plot in Romania, news reports indicate the arrests occurred on Wednesday, March 5, 2025[^2_3][^2_4][^2_6].

# Are there similar events or consequences of "anti-laundering money policy" in Ukraine reported recently in the news?

Yes, recent news reports indicate significant ongoing efforts and consequences related to anti-money laundering (AML) policies in Ukraine:

- Ukraine is actively working to secure the integrity of its financial system to combat corruption and financial crime, which is critical given the large inflows of international aid and the risks posed by the ongoing conflict. The country is under continuous evaluation by international bodies such as the EU and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which expect Ukraine to strengthen oversight of high-risk sectors, virtual assets, and enforcement of AML laws to meet evolving EU standards and global best practices[^3_1].

- A notable case illustrating the consequences of AML enforcement involved the arrest of a Ukrainian entrepreneur suspected of laundering hundreds of millions of euros through real estate in France and Monaco. This investigation, a joint effort by French, Ukrainian, and Monegasque authorities, uncovered illicit profits from illegal arms sales and the sale of shares in a defense company. French authorities froze assets worth €57 million, intending to return them to Ukraine. The suspect was arrested in Monaco in April 2025 and is currently under questioning[^3_2][^3_5].

- Ukraine has also made progress in its anti-corruption ecosystem, including legislative reforms, enforcement achievements, and development of strategies to recover assets. However, challenges remain in fully delineating institutional functions and maximizing the use of available tools to combat corruption and money laundering[^3_3][^3_4].

In summary, Ukraine is under international scrutiny to improve its AML framework and enforcement, with recent high-profile arrests and asset seizures demonstrating tangible consequences of these policies[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3][^3_5].

# Which date for the news about a specific Ukraine stete-bond default?

The news about Ukraine's specific state-bond default on GDP-linked sovereign debt payment dates to early June 2025. Ukraine failed to make a \$665 million payment due on June 2, 2025, to holders of GDP-linked warrants, marking the first default on these instruments[^4_1][^4_3][^4_7]. This was officially reported around May 30 to June 5, 2025, with confirmation from multiple sources including the Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and S\&P Global, which downgraded these bonds to default status on June 5, 2025[^4_1][^4_3][^4_5][^4_7][^4_8].

Thus, the key date for the default event is June 2, 2025, when the payment was due but not made, and the news surfaced publicly between late May and early June 2025.

# How much money the USA pushed into Ukraine, more than \$200 billions? And How much money the USA pushed into Ukraine, more than \$240 billions? Can you verify these numbers, please?

Multiple sources provide different figures for the amount of aid the U.S. has allocated to Ukraine, and these numbers continue to evolve. Here's a breakdown:

* **Approximately \$182.8 billion:** This is the amount of emergency funding the United States allocated to support Ukraine and the region from February 2022 through December 2024[^5_4]. However, "allocated" doesn't mean the money has been spent. So far, the United States has disbursed \$83.4 billion in funding and equipment[^5_4].

* **Approximately \$174.2 billion:** Congress initially appropriated this amount through five Ukraine supplemental appropriation acts enacted in fiscal years 2022 through 2024[^5_1]. Of this, \$163.6 billion was allocated for Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR) and the Ukraine response, and \$10.6 billion was allocated for other, primarily humanitarian, purposes[^5_1]. Additional funds of \$20 billion were allocated from annual agency appropriations and \$1.1 billion was allocated from other supplemental appropriation acts[^5_1].

* **Approximately \$119.7 billion:** The Kiel Institute, a German think tank, estimates that the United States has provided this amount in aid from January 2022 through December 2024[^5_6].

* **Approximately \$66.9 billion:** The U.S. has provided this amount in military assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 [^5_3].

Based on these figures, the U.S. has not yet pushed more than \$200 billion or \$240 billion into Ukraine. The highest figure cited, \$182.8 billion, refers to the total allocated funds, not the amount actually spent[^5_4].

# Is the total US aid to Ukraine closer to \$182.8 billion or over \$240 billion

Based on the available data, the total US aid allocated to Ukraine is closer to \$182.8 billion than \$240 billion [^6_1][^6_2]. This figure represents the total emergency funding allocated by the United States to support Ukraine and the region from February 2022 through December 2024 [^6_1]. However, it's important to note that this is the "allocated" amount, meaning the money that is available, not necessarily what has been spent [^6_1].

As of December 2024, the United States had disbursed \$83.4 billion in funding and equipment [^6_1]. Other estimates, such as those from the Kiel Institute, place the total aid provided at approximately \$119.7 billion for the period from January 2022 through December 2024 [^6_2]. These varying figures depend on the methodology used to calculate the aid, with some including broader categories of spending related to the war in Ukraine [^6_4].

It’s worth noting that the US foreign policy and aid distribution in Ukraine, particularly financial figures and events like the arrival of accountants in Kiev, are areas of interest to you[^6_9].

# How much money from Europe, instead?

Here's an overview of the financial assistance provided by Europe to Ukraine:

* **Total commitments:** The EU and its Member States have made available close to \$199 billion in financial, military, humanitarian, and refugee assistance to Ukraine [^7_1].

* **Breakdown of Assistance:**

    * Close to \$82 billion in financial and budgetary support, as well as humanitarian and emergency assistance [^7_1]. This includes \$31.5 billion in financial assistance in 2022 and 2023, and \$4.2 billion in 2025 [^7_1].

    * Over \$54 billion in military assistance, including contributions from the European Peace Facility and bilateral contributions from Member States [^7_1].

    * Up to \$18 billion from the EU budget to support Ukrainian refugees in EU Member States since February 2022 [^7_1].

* **Ukraine Facility:** In February 2024, European leaders agreed to commit up to \$54 billion until 2027 for the Ukraine Facility, aimed at supporting Ukraine's recovery, reconstruction, and modernization, as well as its reform efforts for EU accession [^7_1].

* **Loans from Immobilized Russian Assets:** The EU and G7 partners agreed to provide loans of \$50 billion to support Ukraine's budgetary, military, and reconstruction needs, financed by extraordinary revenues from immobilized Russian sovereign assets. The EU will contribute \$20 billion to this initiative [^7_1].

* **Comparison with the U.S.:** As of April 2025, total assistance allocated by Europe to Ukraine since 2022 stands at 138 billion euros (\$157 billion), which is 23 billion euros (\$26 billion) more than the U.S. [^7_5]. However, the U.S. has provided more military aid [^7_5].

These figures indicate a substantial financial commitment from Europe to support Ukraine, covering various forms of assistance [^7_1].

As you are following US foreign policy and aid distribution in Ukraine, the EU's role in supporting Ukraine is also relevant [^7_9].
