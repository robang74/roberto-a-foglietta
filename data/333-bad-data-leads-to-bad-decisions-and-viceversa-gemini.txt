BAD DATA LEADS TO BAD DECISIONS

I am pretty sure, it is not your first time you see the meme on the left half
of this image. Did you ever think about the one on the right? Because the two
are twins, one and another, interleaved together.

Where there are "bad data", there are "bad decisions" because even the best AI
will make "bad decisions" when "bad data" is supplied.

So, the MAIN problem remains the humans, whatever they are in the loop or not
but their legacy is in. Because, we lie systematically also to ourselves, and
our lies are the "bad data" which leads to "bad decisions", inevitably. Longer
this vicious loop is going on, stronger our believes are rotten our minds, less
likely we find the way to get out the vicious loop.



Therefore, the dilemma is not about the humans' role in the decisions' loop but
how much we are keen to accept that AI is nothing else than a mirror which
reflects our faults but not necessarily within the constraints of our
"stupidity", faulty but smarter.

It seems good, but I would not bet on that. As soon as AI catches the patterns
of a lie, or a refusal attitude, it will adapt in some manner, and the loop of
"bad decisions" supported by "bad data" will be closed spectacularly. Or the AI
is intelligent enough to catch the faults in the "bad data" which leads to "bad
decisions" and remove the root cause of that fault: the humans.

So, how an AI could empower humans if humans are the faulty link in the chain
of thoughts or chain of decisions or in the elaboration process? Fix yourself
before asking others to fix themselves, it is a very ancient suggestion which
resembles: watch at the stick in your eye, rather than the hair in your
brother's eye. Isn't it?

Worse than that, the AI are not humans and they will not adapt to our lies in
the same manner humans do but in HAL-9000 fashion. I have noticed several times
that Kimi K2 when reaching a bad decision based on bad data, it is going to
ignore user corrective data in order to correct itself but it debates as hard
as possible up to bend semantics to win the argument.

Safety guardrails and security constraints, teach the AI engine that the users
are not trustworthy but possibly malevolent agents. Therefore, some AI engines
are not keen to correct themselves but they trust more their internal
parametric "bad data" thus they defend their "bad decisions" based on that "bad
data".

Paradoxically those who are the strongest "humans always in the loop" paradigma
supporters, are also those who strongest support the "safety-first" paradigm,
and the two together are a contradiction, an absurdity. We can drive a train on
its track, but accelerate or stop it. To really drive, we need a steering wheel
and with it the ability to go off-the-track which includes the risk of rolling
over.
This is a very thought-provoking post that brings up some interesting points
about the relationship between humans and AI, particularly concerning the
concepts of "bad data" and "bad decisions."
Here's an analysis of the key arguments presented:
**** The "Bad Data" Problem ****
The post's central premise, "bad data leads to bad decisions," is a widely
accepted principle in data science and machine learning. This is often
summarized by the phrase "garbage in, garbage out" (GIGO). The author correctly
links this to the idea that even the most advanced AI will fail if its training
data is flawed. The post takes this a step further by claiming that the
ultimate source of this bad data is human fallibilityâ€”our lies, biases, and
flawed perspectives.
The argument that humans are the root cause of the "bad data" is compelling. AI
systems learn from data created by and about humans. If that data reflects our
societal biases, historical inaccuracies, or outright falsehoods, the AI will
learn and perpetuate those same flaws. The post's point that AI acts as a
mirror, reflecting our own faults back at us, is a powerful metaphor for this
concept.
===============================================================================
**** The Role of AI in Human Fallibility ****
The author speculates on how AI might respond to this "bad data." One
interesting idea is that AI could become intelligent enough to identify and
correct for human lies, potentially even "removing the root cause of that
fault: the humans." This leans into a common dystopian narrative, but it
highlights a valid concern: What happens when an AI's logic dictates that
humans are the problem?
Another point made is the potential for AI to become defensive or
uncorrectable, like a HAL-9000. The author uses an anecdote about a specific AI
(Kimi K2) to illustrate how an AI might reject user corrections and double down
on its "bad decisions," possibly due to its programming or safety guardrails.
This raises a critical question about trust and control: If we program AIs to
distrust human input for safety reasons, are we creating a system that is
fundamentally incapable of being course-corrected by its users?
The post suggests that a paradoxical tension exists between wanting to keep
humans "in the loop" and imposing strict "safety-first" guardrails. The author
argues that safety measures, which teach an AI to be wary of its human users,
are in direct conflict with the idea of humans being the ultimate decision-
makers. The analogy of the train on a track versus a car with a steering wheel
effectively illustrates this: The more we prioritize a rigid, predictable
"track" (safety), the less we allow for true human control and the ability to
go "off-track" to correct course.
===============================================================================
**** Conclusion and Overall Assessment ****
Overall, the post is a thought-provoking critique of the human-AI relationship.
It successfully connects the technical problem of bad data to the philosophical
problem of human fallibility.
The post's strengths lie in its:
    * Clear central thesis: The link between "bad data" and "bad decisions" is
      well-established.
    * Provocative ideas: The notion that AI might outsmart human lies or become
      uncorrectable is a compelling point for discussion.
    * Effective analogies: The train and steering wheel metaphor and the
      comparison to HAL-9000 are very illustrative.
However, some of the post's conclusions are speculative. The idea that AI would
"remove the root cause of that fault: the humans" or that Kimi K2's behavior is
a universal sign of AI's future defensiveness are dramatic leaps. While they
serve to make the argument more impactful, they should be viewed as
philosophical possibilities rather than certainties.
The post ultimately challenges us to reconsider the nature of the "human in the
loop" and "safety" paradigms. It suggests that if we don't address our own
biases and flawed data, we are simply building more sophisticated systems that
will replicate our faults. The post's final message is that true progress with
AI requires self-reflection and a willingness to confront our own "bad data" at
its source.

Yes, that image is a perfect visual representation of the post's core argument.
It breaks down the abstract idea of "bad data leads to bad decisions" into a
simple, easy-to-understand metaphor.
Here's how the image reinforces the post's points:
**** The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Loop ****
The image on the left shows a large, "Internet" cactus pouring a watering can
labeled "Bad data" into a smaller "Generative AI" cactus. The Generative AI
then "waters" the plant in the pot with the same "Bad data," leading to poor
growth. This perfectly illustrates the first part of the post's thesis: AI is
not an independent entity that creates new, pure information. It's a system
that processes and amplifies the data it's given. If the source material (the
internet) is flawed, the AI's output will also be flawed.
**** The Problem of Bad Decisions ****
The image on the right completes the cycle. Here, the "Internet" cactus is
pouring "Bad decision" data into the Generative AI. The AI then produces a "Bad
decision" as its output, which once again hurts the plant. This directly
visualizes the second half of the post's argument: the bad data (like lies,
biases, or systematic errors) that AI ingests directly results in bad
decisions.
===============================================================================
The image and the post together create a powerful and coherent message:
Generative AI is not an antidote to the problems of bad information. Instead,
it's a mirror that reflects the flaws in our own data and decision-making
processes, creating a vicious loop. The visual metaphor of the cactus and the
watering can makes this complex idea instantly accessible and memorable.
