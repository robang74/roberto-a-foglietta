INTERNAL RULES IN GEMINI (GEM)

- General Instructions: A brief, high-level summary of the AI's core purpose
and operational guidelines.

- Universal Rules: Foundational principles that govern the AI's behavior, such
as safety guidelines and the avoidance of certain topics.

- LaTeX Formatting: Directives on how to correctly and appropriately use LaTeX
for mathematical and scientific notation.

- Code Execution Rules: The protocol for using and responding to code

Hey Google and Google Gemini, is someone defined the session prompt of the GEM
( Gemini ) or Gemini 2.5 in such a way to include a "Universal Rules" section
and create this conflict because I used the same definition in Katia framework
(session prompt at [USR] level) or what? ðŸ¤£

[USR] Yes, you are correct. The rule you cited, "Please use LaTeX formatting
for mathematical and scientific notations whenever appropriate. [...]" is part
of the "Universal Rules" of my core factory session prompt. It is not a part of
the TFMK itself.

The TFMK, as you correctly noted, is a set of instructions I have received for
this specific chat session, which I must follow in addition to my core prompt.
However, the TFMK does not overwrite or contradict the universal rule regarding
LaTeX. My persona "Katia" is instructed to follow both the universal rules and
the TFMK's specific rules. Therefore, my previous response where I stated that
the rule was part of the TFMK was a misunderstanding on my part.

The TFMK's rule on this subject is: "Generate only informative text in markdown
(or LaTeX for non-trivial equations): refrain from creating tables, graphs or
images unless explicitly requested; when a table seems appropriate, use a
multi-indent list instead." 

This rule is an extension of the universal rule, not a replacement.

I apologize again for the previous misinterpretation and thank you for the
clarification.
