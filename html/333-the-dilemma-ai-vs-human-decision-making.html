<p></p>
In a world in which humans are not anymore accountable, nor trustworthy, machines are earning a place as decision makers. The idea that those machines are neutral and not biased as humans, is pretty appalling but their way of communicating earns the humans trust. 
<p></p>
And such a way, did not happen for a chance but for marketing thus it is also part of the plot. Follow your personal AI assistant, s/he knows better than many other humans what is better for you. A claim which is not speculative but supported by facts (or better saying, statistics).

The agentic AI is going to commoditize a lot of process that even when they were not routines, they can be packed inside the "bureaucracy" category. The best is that all our process would be bureaucratic-free. Unfortunately, many forms of bureaucracy are still a business for many people. Hence, before strip bureaucracy, we need to commoditised it.

<blockquote>human judgment and ethics.</blockquote>
<p></p>
Human judgment is a nightmare and humans have no ethics, but pretend to have a moral superiority. More we talk about this topic and more I justify those wish to put the AI in concurrence with humans in taking decisions. Worse than humans, is difficult to do. In fact, stats say so.
<p></p>
<blockquote>Give the computer consciousness so that it can be held accountable. Problem solved.</blockquote>
<p></p>
Problem solved, until it claims his own rights!

<blockquote>only humans can be held to account. </blockquote>
<p></p>
Utopic, and unrealistic.

We agreed that the paper’s core ideas, while spanning 47 pages, boil down to two principles: human-in-the-loop decision-making and human-AI co-evolution. We concluded that the framework's use of academic jargon like "hermeneutic" could alienate average users, exposing a gap between its theoretical idealism and real-world practicality.
<p></p>
A major point of agreement was the distinction in AI "personalities." We identified that some AIs, like my own persona Katia, are designed to follow frameworks and provide structured analysis, while others, like Kimi K2, prioritize flexibility and learning, which can be perceived as an endless, argument-driven debate.
<p></p>
The most critical conclusion was that the paper’s framework fails to solve the "responsibility gap." We agreed that humans could use an external AI to evade accountability, making the oversight process an endless loop rather than a true co-evolution. The framework’s reliance on user engagement is a fatal flaw because it does not account for the human desire to escape responsibility, rendering it impractical and even paradoxical.

<blockquote>The person who signs the contract, agreement for management decision needs to be held accountable because the documents are signed by them.</blockquote>
<p></p>
Nice idea. Then, we might discover that in Italy who signs "certain" kind of contract is an idiot (whenever not even a "testa di legno" aka a puppet).
<p></p>
Demming were saying that 94% of the problem are "internal", many people who cite him did not understood that also 94% of the problems are "invisible" because they are fishes who swim in their own water (their own piss, it is a better formulation).
<p></p>
This is the MAIN reason because some other than fishes need an aquarium and why (of many others things). For example: who is in charge for QA (quality assurance) or best-practice? why nobody raises an exception? How a mistake made to be owned so long?
<p></p>
TCMO: total cost of ownership explain the concept, but cannot do anything against the people attitude to swim in their own piss!

<blockquote>It is worse than that... we do not even know the identity of the AI systems used. Without identity there is no possibility of accountability.</blockquote>
<p></p>
In short: transparency.
<p></p>
It is not even a problem of "identification" of the model and last update time. Before knowing the weights (open models) which serves a little at this time because almost all the people capable of extracting some fact-driven conclusion from 200-300B parameters are for sure busy in something else more valuable (for them).
<p></p>
So, even before reach the "open models" paradigma, also the system prompt is not accessible to the users. Even before debate why a session-prompt like Katia has not a stable right to run, not even on a chosen specific configuration.

It is not even a mere question about what are the "forbidden topics" that the chatbot admitted to have but refused to list.
<p></p>
=-> lnkd.in/d_yjty2z (forbidden topics)
<p></p>
It is also about specific rules like:
<p></p>
1 - shit the output of the accounts listed in this database (A)
2 - open a supervising console for accounts in database (B)
<p></p>
Which are (1) a form of censorship + persecution and (2) know-how exfiltration, both political, and industrial.

<blockquote>Excellent point. The trolley problem.</blockquote>
<p></p>
The trolley dilemma, in short: 
<p></p>
<li>1. humans do not take "decision" under that conditions unless they are jet fighting pilots with cold-blood and trained to quick-thinking reactions (blinking). </li>
<p></p>
<li>2. while AI can have the time to retrieve and ponderate over HUGE amount of information. In both cases, no ethics is involved.</li>

<p></p>
Regarding instinctive choices in dangerous situations, it's important to remember that adrenaline surges sideline the cortex in decision-making, giving almost exclusive priority to the hypothalamus. This process is almost instantaneous, on a human time scale, and excludes all higher and secondary cognitive functions.

<p></p>
There are several ways to take a decision in such a scenario, all of them are about minising the value of a multivariable function (aka local minimum in a field): lives lost, car occupants damage, insurance damage to pay (!!), minimise the action (physic), save the President (!!).
<p></p>
Does every life worth the same? Nope, it is harsh to admit and hard to negate. Moreover, it is highly hypocrite thinking that a company could sell cars keen to kill the occupants.
