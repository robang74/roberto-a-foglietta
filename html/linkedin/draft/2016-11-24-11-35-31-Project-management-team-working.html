  <h2>Premise</h2> 
  <p>In the last 20 years, I have developed my own working methodology. Recently, I formalized it and developed a mathematical model about it [not yet translated]. </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/project-management-concetti-di-base-roberto-a-foglietta" target="_blank">Project Management: concetti di base</a>&nbsp;(19 ottobre 2016)</li>

  </ul> 
  <p>Due this method the initial knowledge of a subject is not much relevant for the results as long as there are some kind of knowledge sources available around.&nbsp;Which is about the management principle for which, there is not the strictly need to be fully proficient in any aspects of a technical domain to properly managed it.</p> 
  <h3>Introduction</h3> 
  <p>The approach described into the three articles above is not a magic wand, it is much more a basic principle widespread in nature on which auto-organization emerges from chaos. </p> 
  <p>It is not a magic wand because its results are depending on the good will and attitude to work towards a common goal despite personal low-terms interests.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>This is the reason because it works wonderful under critical or emergency situations in which it is pretty clear to everybody the importance of reaching a solution rather than any other individual goals.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>More in general, it works pretty well when the currency that people exchange in their interpersonal working relationship is based on "<em>motivation</em>" rather than "<em>importance</em>" even if the two aspect are related, they are not equivalent.</p> 
  <h3>Short comings</h3> 
  <p>As far as I know, the approach I developed is irrelevant in any political context (except for statistics) or any context in which opinions (like entertainment, arts, etc.) are the primary value. Moreover, confronting the literature about gain consensus or popularity and this method, these two models have different behavioral and structure.</p> 
  <h3>People and results</h3> 
  <p>People have a inner scale of priorities: 1) survive and improve their living conditions (physical needs), 2) being accepted and recognized by people around (psychosocial needs), 3) self-actualization (individuality needs).&nbsp;</p> 
  <div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-middle"> 
   <img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5612AQFP4Jym1H3rrw" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQFP4Jym1H3rrw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1520249626336?e=1746057600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=lFsqGL3Bz1dEON0MZoMNrsyL6hsfmRHMVCP59sR79jQ"> 
  </div> 
  <p>When a natural auto-organization key rule is injected into a productive environment, things progressively start to happen and people progressively start to perceive a lack of their own control, they progressively start perceiving their individual contribution less clearly which is reducing their perception of self-importance and because of this their perception of insecurity progressively is going to increase.</p> 
  <p>As much as the common goal is a survival need, this way of working is going to be welcome (things are going better, who cares about why or who?). As less as the common goal is not perceived (rightly or wrongly) as a survival necessity, people feel that this way of working will hurt their importance and self-actualization.&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>Cultural biases</h3> 
  <p>This is a cultural bias which strongly influence the perception (facts interpretation).&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Strongly individually oriented cultures or at the opposite strongly group oriented cultures may easily accept <em>individual</em> <em>insecurity</em> or <em>mesh contribution</em> perceptions.</p> 
  <p>Those cultures that are nor strongly oriented to a) personal risk management or b) the higher importance of the group rather than individual, have more difficulties to deal with a way of working in which results are not strictly dependent or related by anyone in particular but to the way of working together.</p> 
  <p>When something goes wrong, people are looking for "<em>an enemy threatening or a problem arising" </em>explanation rather than "<em>a methodological faulty approach</em>" explanation. <em>Is there a problem</em>? <em>Is there a responsible</em>? Instead of, <em>how we miss to catch this before</em>?</p> 
  <p>Because of this, it is not easy to realize "<em>inside-out</em>" the importance of a methodology rather than people or team working - which are two essential elements - but not alone. </p> 
  <h3>Successful Innovation</h3> 
  <p>Successful innovation strongly depends to the ability of a group of people to collaborate efficiently within a mesh structure and self-organization way of working. </p> 
  <p>There is not any doubts that a group of people working for a common goal will achieve much more effective results if their collaboration will be not affected by personal agendas and contrasts (me or you instead of we), strict roles and rules (we always did in this way, it is forbid) and responsibilities (this is not a problem of mine, it is your fault). </p> 
  <p>In simple words there are a huge difference between a team focused on winning the game and a group of people sharing some interests but not aligned on the main vision.</p> 
  <p>Rigid structures and top-down approaches rarely demonstrated to be innovative. It may seem differently because most innovative companies has been founded by visionaries with a strong charisma. A strong leader (queen bee) is necessary to grant the acceptance that everyone except the leader is part of the same common mesh (bees).</p> 
  <h3>Sport teams example</h3> 
  <p>The sport teams in which there is a super-champion have a greater probability of success, not because the super-hero, but because his/er presence make the rest of the team play the game instead trying to reach the first position. Moreover a super-one could change suddenly some game rules surprising the adversaries (creative solutions) or to face an unusual situation (fast response time).</p> 
  <p>Unfortunately the sport teams example is not relevant in general because there is a high competition about a single <em>simple</em> task (making more points than others). It is a <em>simple</em> task in the sense that it very clear for everybody which brings to win or to fail (single dimension problem). This inner simplicity helps greatly to identify the champion, as well. When multi-dimensional goals come into the scene, the "<em>best in a specific class</em>" is not necessarily the best leader and about management is again another story (have you ever seen a football manager play itself or need to be a champion-of-the-past?)</p> 
  <h3>A Comparison and a receipt</h3> 
  <p>Football players that will not pass the ball to their champion will be catch immediately in their intentions. Instead, in complex environments the political oriented behaviors will easily lead to social regarded positions race rather than any other strategy. </p> 
  <p>When a high bonus or a high penalty (e.g. loss of the bonus) will effect the entire team - in case of success or failure - also a multi-dimension team behavior will resemble the sport team behavior because within the team itself there are the competencies to catch those people do not play for the common goal and every team member know this.</p> 
  <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
  <p>There is not a conclusion. Not one, at least. Whatever is the reason (a crisis, an emergency, a bonus or a penalty) increasing the team members awareness about the <em>necessity</em> of playing the same game as a unique entity is the key of great results.</p> 
  <p>The word <em>necessity</em> is used for a purpose: any perception else than seeing the common goal like a individual necessity will not drive the working model from "<em>I want to be the number one in my own group of peers</em>" (individual driven) to "<em>I want my team became the number one among others teams</em>" (goal oriented).</p> 
  <p>The leadership plays a relevant role in this shift. However the common lacks of effective leadership progressively allowed another kind of leadership emerging. The <em>political leadership</em> is the art to make others people feel important but there is a huge difference between making people feel <em>motivated</em> and feel <em>important</em>. </p> 
  <p>People have a strong natural attitude to reciprocity. When reciprocity is based on the <em>importance</em> then people will exchange that currency instead of the <em>motivation</em> one. While <em>motivation</em> currency pushes others to improve themselves the <em>importance</em> currency goes towards to hide theirs mistakes, faults, critics, etc.</p> 
  <p>Better belonging to a group because mutual survival needs or because feeling important among that group? The second! - WRONG. There are much more tolerance, respect and results production in the first group than in the second one.</p> 
  <p>I give you importance, if you give me importance. I buy from you importance paying to you importance. This is the main (and simplified) message of Napoleon Hills' "<em>Think and grow rich</em>" book [¹]: people easily trade <em>importance</em> as a currency rather <em>motivation</em> because <em>motivation</em> is harder to give and receive. </p> 
  <p>Who does not care to have friends and supporters?</p> 
  <p>When facts are not easily evident, who cares about facts?</p> 
  <h3>A test</h3> 
  <p>When a coworker or friend show us an our fault: we thanks him/er or we put in doubts our friendship? We may answer: it depends in the way s/he did. Tip: it does not. What matters is his/er will to work and collaborate with us despite our fault or not. However our willingness to consider him/er a friend depends from irrelevant facts but social bias.</p> 
  <p>Social biases are really important. They are the thickest wall to bypass in order to help people to change in better, to be more creative, to be more <em>effective</em> successful. </p>

  <p>[¹] Think and Grow Rich was written in 1937 by Napoleon Hill, promoted as a personal development and self-improvement book. Hill writes that he was inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and (later) philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. While the book's title and much of the text concerns increased income, the author insists that the philosophy taught in the book can help people succeed in any line of work, to do and be anything they can imagine.
