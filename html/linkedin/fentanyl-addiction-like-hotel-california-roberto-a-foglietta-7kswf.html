It seems absurd because we are used to think that they do laws that should be respected and enforced, but this is a simplistic view.</p><p>Aliens in Italy are out-laws but welcomed because being an out-law alien means participating in a cheap labor market. Politics get money, business men get advantages, criminals leverage it, people are bribed with cheaper food/goods.</p><p>We - the people - need to see the whole picture about our governs and the authorities. Otherwise, we are not going to understand and powerless. Unaware people cannot change anything, whatever is the level of pressure they push towards The Wall (Pink Floyd).</p><p>Now, back to the title of this comment. In USA there are living tens of millions Fentanyl addicted people among tens of millions automatic rifle owners. It is an high unstable and explosive social mix.</p><p>More, because Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, it is practical impossible cure the addiction but just in some specific and not-common cases. While the bare assumption stop, is a hell of pain and if did in an abruptly way deadly as well.</p><p>[...2]</p><p>[2...]</p><p>On such a large scale, the only solution is to provide low-cost Fentanyl to the crackheads hoping for the better but slowing going towards the worst but not suddenly.</p><p>The "not suddenly" is the ESSENTIAL characteristic for the politics because everyone is able to notice a sudden change but usually few notice a trend. Even exponential trends are overlooked by the experts because the first part of the exponential curve is quite flat and the skyrockets at such pace that nobody can control it anymore.</p><p>Who produce Fentanyl? Mainly China. In the past, Fentanyl was entering in the USA as semi-finished raw material for meds an in particular pain-killer meds. Authorities discovered that 90% of that inflow was a surplus compared the meds production.</p><p>In that moment they got in touch with the REAL problem: private health insurance was more keen to pay for pain-killers rather than a cure especially when hospitalization was needed. The same for the NHS but because the budget constrains.</p><p>This is the REAL reason because tens of millions of good american people has been driven into a viscous drug addition. In a different scenario the crackheads drug addiction is a marginal social issue, like in EU countries.</p><p>[...3]</p><p>[3...]</p><p>In that moment they got they have to make a deal with China about Fentanyl supply because jeopardizing that supply would create an HUGE and SUDDEN social outbreak.</p><p>They got a deal: a stable and cheap Fentanyl supply in exchange of the promise of reducing the custom tax pressure on Chinese products entering in USA. Guess what? USA did not keep their own word and China decided to stop providing Fentanyl to USA in such large quantities but started to provide it to Mexico.</p><p>This plot-twist made the drug dealer cartels very happy of expanding a highly profitable business and receiving a sort of privilege even if not a total exclusive on the Fentanyl distribution.</p><p>The FBI and DEA manage to shutdown a route or jail an entire cartel? Shortage of cocaine happens, the price raises up, poor people goes for crack or reduce the consumption. With Fentanyl, the demand is NOT elastic unless facing a hell of pain.</p><p>Therefore the supply chain SHOULD be resilient. The most efficient way to establish a resilient large scale supply chain is having a large and very well distributed PoS network. Like a blood system: large arteries are fragile but many small arteries are resilient. Also for the cash collection, a network is good.</p><p>[...4]</p><p>[4...]</p><p>Also for the cash collection, a network is good. BUT NOT for criminal activities. A lot of drug-dealer collect money that might not return back to Mexican drug cartel and go after all of them is a HUGE credit rescue problem.</p><p>This is when the Mexican aliens got into the scene. They WANT enter in USA for achieving better living standards - for this they are keen to fulfill the cheap labor market and also assist the Fentanyl supply-chain. In a Mexican family of 8 people, 4 cross the border, 2 work for achieving a USA long-term VISA and other 2 support the Fentanyl supply chain, money laundering and the credit back-outflow towards Mexico.</p><p>With this schema everybody win. Politics keep their chairs, FBI and DEA agents are not involved in life-treating operations but just go after smaller streets dealers which usually are not aggressive but submissive. Mexican people greatly improves their chance to settle down in USA or got a long-term VISA. Drug cartels enjoy one of the most profitable, secured and vast business since the end of alcohol prohibitionism's era. Addicted people can have their daily cheap access to Fentanyl and others people do not notice anything particularly wrong around.</p><p>[...5]</p><p>[5...]</p><p>Common people do not notice anything particularly wrong around. But along the time the mess is growing and rising.</p><p>At this point, the mess is grow-up enough that the federal government cannot close the Mexico border anymore without risking a HUGE and SUDDEN social outbreak with impossible to forecast consequences.</p><p>The Texas governor and residents are not agree with being the gate of such aliens inflow because they are those that pay the early birds ticket for such traffic. Not the only one, but in other states the dilution of the inflow can be more easily overlooked.</p><p>At this point, the American people can only choose if they wish to put an end of the American Dream by a civil war that will makes tens of millions death even if fought with paintball rifles - almost all the Fentanyl addicted people will die because the sudden stop of Fentanyl assumption - XOR letting the American Dream die a slow and sedate death.</p><p>Whatever your choice will be, I strongly suggest you, american people and USA authorities, to quickly move the Western leadership - the global leadership is just lost - back to Europe because otherwise, the whole Western will be in high danger and moreover Europe would not able to help you.</p><p>Wishing the best, R-</p><hr><hr><h3>Share alike</h3><p>© 2024, <a href="http://www.roberto.foglietta.name/" target="_blank">Roberto A.
