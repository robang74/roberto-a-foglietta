  <h2><strong>Whatever you think, the box is the first customer buy</strong></h2> 
  <p>Spending some time in boosting your profile my lead you to a better paid job or land you to your dream job. If you are a professional consultant you may&nbsp;outmatch the competition with a proper and nice presentation.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Because each business and professional profile is unique or it would be, specific suggestion need to be tailored. However, some tool and trick here following explained will be able to improve your presentation in some ways.</p> 
  <p>You are&nbsp;Clark Kent behind Superman - be Superman, humility pays off in your granny bedtime stories - prove to others that you are able to use a promotional and communication tool in a proficiency way. Play with bell and whistles but do not fake relevant information about your skills and business - be authentic.&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3><strong>(1) Become&nbsp;Premium</strong></h3> 
  <p>Becoming premium is the simplest way to boost your profile and empower your communications tools. It costs but if you are a professional, you could get back your investment easily. Paying for an yearly plan give you an important discount.</p> 
  <h3><strong>(2) Personal and background images</strong></h3> 
  <p>We are humans and we are tailored to recognise and give value to human faces. Not matters how much you consider yourself ugly - as long as you are not a company - others people wish to see your face at the same distance they will see you if you were in front of them. Too far or too near is not good.</p> 
  <p>Here the suggestions are quite simple: half body picture in your professional suite&nbsp;and take the shoot in a place that is coherent with your job or business. A relaxed smile to see would be much more welcoming for others people approaching your profile. Angle of view: straight in the eyes.</p> 
  <p>You did your best to take the best shoot, then put your picture into a grey shades frame. The grey is neutral, enough good with every other colours and you will not have to change it when you will change background image. The frame will highlight your picture and personalise your profile respect the others. White balancing and gamma correction and colour saturation for your picture are the must, advanced filtering would be appreciate as long as will not make you look like an alien (if you were not such alien!).</p> 
  <p>You put a lot of effort in presenting yourself - so far - you cannot keep the standard background. Choose an image that is relevant&nbsp;to your profession&nbsp;- as long as you were not into funeral business avoid black, white or greys - usually saturated colours and reduced contrast will give you a background that will not steal the scene from you and will please the eyes. In few cases, you may choose a background that reflects one of your interest - this could be good as much as this off-the-work activity characterising and brings value to you (e.g.: mountain climbing). Your holidays photos are probably not the good ones.</p> 
  <p>Your picture and the background images are two important elements of a story you wish to tell those reach your profile.&nbsp;Without a story, a profile is like a static and uninteresting frame instead of being a emotional&nbsp;touching&nbsp;video.</p> 
  <h3><strong>(3) Enlarge your professional network</strong></h3> 
  <p>Every person knows a lot of people. Every one you add to your network will bring you more new connections and opportunities. Two simple ways to enlarge your networks is to let LinkedIn access your Google, Outlook, Yahoo, etc. address books both by computer and mobile phone. Keep professional because adding your pub or elementary school friends - as long as they were not your colleagues - will not bring you any value and may drive you down into unprofessional dangerous cliffs about chitchatting and comparisons.</p> 
  <h3><strong>(4) Curriculum Vitae -vs- LinkedIn Profile</strong></h3> 
  <p>Your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile is not your Curriculum Vitae, because:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile is different depending who is looking at it: yourself, your connections and public - use the blue button [ View profile as ] to see how your profile looks like to others. The menu [ V ] on the left of such blue button allows you to download a straight textual PDF version.</li> 
   <li>your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile is not your Curriculum Vitae. The CV is usually tailored for a specific job position and include a introduction letter or some kind of initial presentation - you can download your profile in a&nbsp;PDF and&nbsp;use it as last-minute emergency CV but it would look horrible.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Your profile in PDF could be useful to <a href="https://www.adzuna.co.uk" target="_blank">evaluate your market value in UK by Adzuna</a>. You may not care about UK market because you are living far away, however this tool will let you able to improve your CV. Because UK is pretty competitive market for information technology and many others sectors, the estimated value in pounds of your skills, would make a rule of thumb about which job position are suitable for you and those are better paid, today (tomorrow is another story).</p> 
  <h3><strong>Increase your value improving your curriculum vitae</strong></h3> 
  <p>My&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile is evaluated (yesterday)&nbsp;£53,418 and (today) £47,999&nbsp;while my initial&nbsp;Curriculum Vitae up to £63,453. Does this mean that I did well my homework about my CV? Are these number reasonable?</p> 
  <p>There is always a space for an improvement. Among others minor flaws <a href="https://www.adzuna.co.uk" target="_blank">Adzuna</a>&nbsp;shown me that my CV was too long and 98% of my colleagues have a shorter CV than mine. I cut off by the half and&nbsp;it still be&nbsp;longer than 92% of other seniors but the value increased up to £83,482.</p> 
  <p>Using another tool&nbsp;<a href="https://app.enhancv.com/invite?id=57b365a58baee01100436b89&amp;utm_source=link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=invite-friends" target="_blank">EnhanCV</a>&nbsp;I managed to present myself as IT consultant and as Innovation Manager with two different 1-single-page executive presentations. Well, the first&nbsp;is evaluated&nbsp;£33,054 while the second&nbsp;£66,537.</p> 
  <p>Looking at these numbers, we may agree that all that glitters is not gold and artificial intelligence is not ready to judge the human being, yet. However, this set of tools gives you a glimpse about how are probably most of the recruiters, driven by the AI of their own company IT&nbsp;systems, are dealing with your CV.</p> 
  <p>So far, forget your Curriculum Vitae and entrust in your professional network.</p>
