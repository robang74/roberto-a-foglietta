  <h3>Hi guys and ladies, which one is the best for you? </h3> 
  <p>Do you prefer it in the Peanuts or the Boring English version?</p> 
  <h2>Peanuts English</h2> 
  <ol> 
   <li><em>He have tried so many paths that returning to the old one would make a news.</em></li> 
   <li><em>She walked so far away that returned home from the other side.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Life is like a school bus, it brings new learning everyday but everybody scream when it suddenly starts or stops.</em></li> 
   <li><em>You can see the stars but not your nose but if you could, everybody would gaze at it.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Seeing so many thing to turn blind.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Waves are lower where the sea is deeper.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Digging so deep to get out.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Anomalies are not the all the same, some are in who is looking others outside.</em></li> 
   <li><em>She talked so much that when she took a breath, others too.</em></li> 
   <li><em>He told me that you told him that I told you, remind me about what?</em></li> 
   <li><em>It is not your business until someone stick your name on it.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Being like the devil, invited once, never left anymore.</em></li> 
   <li><em>You can clean the shit but not the smell and trying to cover, makes it more fancy.</em></li> 
   <li><em>As garbled as a kitty fur ball.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Check the water before jumping in the pool.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Sharks sense the blood miles away like the postmen the shower is getting wet.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Looking at the phone, it will never ring but sit down on the WC and the entire world will look for you.</em></li> 
   <li><em>The sky is blue, the grass is green, the meeting was quick and everybody are happy.</em></li> 
   <li><em>We may start with the good news or the bad one. The bad news is that we do not have good news.</em></li> 
   <li><em>A hot bikini will never roast a sausage but it will catch a lot of pigs.</em></li> 
   <li><em>The easiest way to make your meadow land a new seeding field, it is claiming you had hidden over there a pot of gold while you are drunk at the pub.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Both drunk people and kids say the truth but kids are those only that remains unpunished.</em></li> 
   <li><em>Loneliness gets drunk alone, friends make a party.</em></li> 
   <li><em>A bird first flight starts with a fall but falling down will not make you a bird nor learning you how to fly.</em></li> 
   <li><em>An avalanche always starts because a small crack but a small crack does not always make an avalanche.</em></li>
