  <h3>The master</h3> 
  <p>If you see someone behind you, do not suppose s/he is on the back of you. S/he may have run more loops than you. Do not suppose either that s/he want to surpass you. S/he may will push faster you. Do not suppose to be the master because your age or your position because you may discover that you can learn more than you can teach. A master helps people to be better that themselves and someone became a master when s/he never give up to learn from anybody. You will never know, you are the master but others does.</p> 
  <h3>People growth</h3> 
  <p>People grow, if loved and educated. The first step to educate them, it is speaking to them. To love them, it is speaking the truth. It is your fear that their growth succeed over you that block you to do these and achieve the great result. If you recognise this fear in you, then do not pretend to be the master. It easier to elevate someone pulling up to you but it is more useful, you stoop at his/her eyes level and then pushing him/her up with you. Better, guiding him/her to raise by themselves. Do not forget to praise their efforts and to celebrate their results. Do not punish mistakes because they are an important and unavoidable part of the learning process. The fear to fail, will block their growth.</p> 
  <h3>Watching you</h3> 
  <p>Spying people is a form of torture, never trust information extorted by torture because their came from the voice of need to stop the torture not to deliver you a reliable nor useful information. However, give a wo/man a mask and s/he will easily say you the truth, such kind of truth, s/he will never say otherwise. In both cases, be bold but delicate. Because when you are digging in the deep of a person, you will never know, if you will find a candy or a thunderstorm. Be cautious as well. Because in the dark of another person inside, you may find a mirror and such a monster you would see, it may be you.</p> 
  <h3>Caring you</h3> 
  <p>There is a little but subtle difference between spying an watching, your will to be visible. Moreover, there is a huge difference between watching and observing: understanding. There is small a difference between seeing for seeing and seeing for desire: being hungry. Finally, there is a warm difference between observing and admiring: compassionate love. Means nothing understand an event but missing to catch the soul involved.</p> 
  <p>Do not make people fail because they will need you. They might be not good enough to succeed despite you but rarely they will be so stupid to not realise about your real intention. Do not make them succeed because of you, either.</p> 
  <h3>Expectation</h3> 
  <p>You can teach for the good but you cannot prevent it would be used for the bad, neither you will be able to fully control this aspect. You can teach someone to be stronger, challenging him/her. You may will to prepare him/her for the bad times but think twice before being his/her bad time. If you want to grow a bad person, betray him/her but keep in consideration that everything turns around and will be back to you, soon or later. Do not suppose that no reaction means a lack of feeling. Those have more patience, resilience and higher level of tolerance are able to give you back strong and unpredictable reactions. Do not try to change a character of a person but address her/his habits.</p> 
  <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
  <p>Bring all together and remember: if you cannot be the light, do not be the shadow.</p>
