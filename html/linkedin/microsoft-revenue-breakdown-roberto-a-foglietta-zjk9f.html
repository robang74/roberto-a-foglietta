  <div><hr><p>The XBOX platform can compete with the PlayStation but the hardware is pretty the same on both platforms. This means that the challenge is about the software / operative system, the marketing to keep the games catalog wide and the units sold in large quantities. The large quantity sold grants to be competitive about the price.</p><p>About the Office suite alternatives, I wrote an article about that.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/optimal-office-suite-large-enterprises-roberto-a-foglietta-mdhff/" target="_blank">Optimal Office Suite for Large Enterprises</a> (9 feb 2024)</p></li></ul><p>I am not an expert of cloud platforms and therefore, I skip to rate Azure especially because I never used it. However, these three: Windows, Office and Azure are made to work together. AFAIK, the Microsoft data centers including those running Azure and GPT are almost completely running with GNU/Linux systems.</p><p>While <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7196715344416116736/#">OpenAI</a> ChatGPT can compete with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7196715344416116736/#">Google</a> Gemini AI, the search engine BING cannot clearly compete with it. While, the combination with BING + GPT may possibly compete with it. However, the BING engine is made to work with those three platforms listed above and the integration with GPT is going in the same direction.</p><hr><h3>The Microsoft dream</h3><p>The dream of Microsoft is a company infrastructure running Outlook servers, accessed by Windows clients with Office 365 by a dedicated VPN on a WAN, and connected with Azure cloud by a dedicated VPN on the public Internet. In which users are using BING + AI for searching among company data and documents, possibly for Internet and news also.</p><p>This dream came true because it was the US gov dream, also. Hence, every company that adopts this way of doing their IT, is a subsidiary of the US gov. Whatever they might like or not.</p><p>This includes every public administration, also. </p><hr><h3>The BRICS and the open-source</h3><p>The obvious consequence is that those countries that joined the BRICS bandwagon for the dedollarisation of the international markets and financial system are also in need of a open-source alternative.</p><p>The open-source characteristic is fundamental when needing to be in charge of our own IT infrastructure and being able to review the code internals, repair it and autonomously develop it.</p><hr><h3>The Microsoft fortune</h3><p>Returning to the chart, the best three products that are on the top list of revenue inflow are XBOX, Linkedin and GPT. None of them has been developed by Microsoft but they just bought. So, if the money bought the Microsoft owned best products, where did the Microsoft money come from?</p><p>Some people think that they became rich when they stole the NEXT's windows-based OS and they sell it as their own product. This can prove that even Windows OS has not been made by them but is wrong thinking that it is the reason for their fortune. Doing a step back, the MS-DOS was a worse alternative to the IBM DR-DOS but the DR-DOS floppy disks set was protected by the copy. Few people were able to copy it, despite protection.</p><p>Copying is fundamental to spread around a software. Because a license is not only a cost but a time delay, especially before Internet. Windows inherits the same goodness: easy to copy, hence easy to spread. When Windows became the standard de-facto about personal computing, the US Congress made a law and a huge lobbying operation that enforced all WTO countries contrasting copying as piracy and piracy as felony.</p><p>Easy-to-copy and the US gov support made Microsoft guys rich. This is the main reason because they are a subsidiary of the US gov. In the good and in the bad.</p><hr><h3>Most hated by coders</h3><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanlabbe/" target="_blank">Nathan Labbe</a> wrote that <a target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a> is the most hated cloud platform by the coders. I am getting this statement as-is without any first-hand knowledge nor experience about it. But just in case, it is worth remembering that the dot-net was the most hated platform by the coders. Before it, Visual Studio GUI and before it, Visual Basic.</p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQFWQ4P2Kyi6Sg" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFWQ4P2Kyi6Sg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1715832983382?e=1746057600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=HXRNl6H23IkAuVAy3E9NoffqQ6N4wccoEfrm1fkZV0g"><figcaption>Nathan Labbe's post screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, if Azure won the "<em>most hated by coders</em>" prize then it is part of a three decades unbeaten supremacy. Why the hell, they had and detained the supremacy in being hated by their own users and still making money?</p><p>About money, we said. Why are they still largely spread? We said, also. Why did they not change to be loved, instead. They do not need and moreover, love attracts positive people. Positive people can stay positive as long as they are allowed to be critical thinkers and free to do their job without paying for support but learning by doing.</p><hr><h3>Microsoft vs Innovation</h3><p>Independence, freedom and critical thinking are three knights that never received support nor welcomed by the US gov as you can imagine and despite propaganda. While democracy is harmless, as long as we can only choose between bad or worse.</p><p>So, if you are wondering why Microsoft is not an innovative company, the answer is straightforward at this point. Their company culture is much more dedicated to marketing rather than creativity plus they are champions in sucking away all the fun from people who are the real doers.</p><hr><h3>Our best hope about Microsoft</h3><p>The best we can hope is that <a target="_blank">Microsoft</a> top management wakes-up and decides to take over the US gov bringing fairness where they brought war, order where they brought corruption and love where they spread hate. Ok, the last aim is above their capabilities.</p><p>This is the main reason because I am here on <a target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> when by my personal attitude and career path I would move on <a target="_blank">beBee, Inc.</a> social a lot of years ago. Or simply, abandon the social networks at all.</p><hr><hr><h3>Share alike</h3><p>Â© 2024, <a href="http://www.roberto.foglietta.name/" target="_blank">Roberto A.
