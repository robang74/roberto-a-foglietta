  <div><p><em>Article created by Gemini, published 9th February 2024 [2nd draft]</em></p><hr><h3>DISCLAIMER &amp; PREMISE</h3><p>This article has been almost entirely written by <a target="_blank">Google</a> Gemini A.I., and I just checked it on the basis of my limited experience of using and keeping running a large company Office Suite system. Hence, it is published here as an usage example of Gemini for a quite challenging task rather than a trustworthy guide for taking a decision about this subject. Also, Gemini closed its answer with similar advice.</p><p><strong>No guarantee:</strong> check with your IT department before making a choice or a change. Moreover, check with your employees among your different departments because not all of them are working with documents in the same manner, method, style or are in need of full compatibility with <a target="_blank">Microsoft</a> documents.</p><p>In some specific cases, you might be surprised to discover that <a href="https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/" target="_blank">TexMaker</a> (or a similar editor for LaTeX) is their preferred choice for publishing R&amp;D or scientific papers. Moreover, we might agree or argue that Open Source solutions are more or less a suitable solution, but <strong>for sure,</strong> adopting a strictly Open Format policy as per default will let your company easily change in the future (vendor lock-in mitigation) and facilitate collaboration with those companies that made a different choice than yours.</p><p>For all public administrations, the Open Format policy should be considered a <strong>MUST</strong> even if your domestic law does not impose it. In fact, no citizen should refrain from freely accessing public documentation produced with their own tax money, for whatever reason.</p><h3>Prompt</h3><p><em>Compare OpenOffice, Microsoft office 365 and OnlyOffice for large business.</em></p><p>In the following the words written in italic font are those replace or added or by the human author. No any removal have did take place, instead.</p><hr><h3>Selecting the Optimal Office Suite for Large Enterprises</h3><p>Choosing the right office suite for a large enterprise requires a meticulous evaluation of several critical factors: budget, security posture, existing infrastructure, feature requirements, and user adoption potential.</p><h3>A Comparative Analysis</h3><p>Here's <em>below</em> a comprehensive comparison of OpenOffice, Microsoft Office 365, and OnlyOffice [3] to empower your informed decision-making.</p><hr><p><strong>OpenOffice Strengths:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em> </em><strong>Cost-efficiency</strong>: freely available, eliminating licensing fees, ideal for budgetary constraints.</p></li><li><p><em> </em><strong>Cross-platform Compatibility</strong>: seamless operation across Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms, ensuring adaptability.</p></li><li><p><em> </em><strong>Offline Accessibility</strong>: basic functionality remains available even without an internet connection, fostering flexibility.

Consider conducting trials with each solution before making a final decision to ensure the best fit for your enterprise landscape.</p><hr><h3>NOTE</h3><p>These notes have been entirely written by the human author, except for #4, where the text has been taken from the Microsoft website.</p><ol><li><p>We may agree or not that Microsoft Office 365 is safe, safer, or the safest solution to adopt in terms of cyber-security but, for sure, because it is the most widely spread Office Suite, especially in large companies, this implies that discovering a day-0 bug or exploit on it in order to access or alter information by malicious third parties or attackers is worth much more than a similar discovery for every other Office Suite. In particular, that value is not as simple as linear but more than linear, tendentiously exponential like the #1 - the market leader's {fees, prices, revenues} charts usually show. This also means that your company's IT department will need to stay safe {posture, updates, alert, etc.} much more even if Office 365 is adopted with the Azure cloud, which - for the reasons expressed above - tends to be a must as long and as much Microsoft provides security fixes and support (aka dedicated support in the list above).</p></li><li><p>Data availability is partially included in cyber-security but completely contained in it, or written in other words: data availability intersects cyber-security and vice versa. For example, data availability can depend on Internet or private network availability. A rat that eats and cuts a cable is not a typical cyber-security threat but a risk that should be mitigated by Risk Management which is a broader area of intervention and planning than the two above. For example, adopt two physically separated connections from two different network operators and join the two backbones into a single virtual network stub. Moreover, while cyber-security is mainly focused on protecting data from unauthorised access, modification, or corruption from internal and external attackers - the data availability is about business continuity, or sometimes Reputation Management. For some data, it is better to lose them rather than be disclosed, especially publicly disclosed while usually it is the opposite. In fact, an industrial secret, even if unauthorizedly leaked, is still protected by law in some fashion. While some data leaks are going to damage the reputation in a way that is not easy to quantify in a short or longer period of time. For example, a recent EU law establishes that public administrations are responsible for paying damages due to an information leak, whether the damage is proved or not, and they are on duty to prove that no damage happened because of the leak. Moreover, some information is not reputation-sensitive by itself, but it might be in the future when combined with other leaks or other information. In practice, this has a strong impact on storage and safety policies. Usually, passwords offer a weak protection level, but they are easy to adopt, use and reset. On the contrary, other forms of safe storage might lead to a data loss event rather than unauthorised access. As you can imagine, this implies a not-so-banal trade-off between security and availability. Another data availability risk is about the cloud, which is usually is completely driven by a third-party company and accessed under a B2B contract. Finally, data availability is also about the format in which that data has been stored, and in this case, the vendor lock-in is the peak of the iceberg about the data format.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/CommunityServer" target="_blank">OnlyOffice Community Server</a> - A free open source office suite with business productivity tools: document and project management, CRM, mail aggregator.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy" target="_blank">Microsoft Copilot Data Security and Privacy</a> - &lt;&lt;<em>When a user interacts with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 apps (such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote, Loop, or Whiteboard), we store data about these interactions.
