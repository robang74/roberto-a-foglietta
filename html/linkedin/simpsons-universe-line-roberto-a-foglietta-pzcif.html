  <div><p><em>Article written starting from </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_great-work-minions-simpsons-serie-confirms-activity-7218638034139811844-o5XS" target="_blank"><em>a post</em></a><em> published on LinkedIn on 15th July 2024</em></p><hr><p>Imagine that the bullet shot to Donald Trump would have killed him. You might imagine that the JFK plot would have take place again. Or not.</p><p>The America at JFK epoch was an extremely rich country and driven by technology and science. The American Dream was at its best and JFK was the man that was in charge to make it even shine brighter. But for the deep state, he was the President that he was treating their existence.</p><p>Americans were loving JFK like UK people were loving Princess Diana but their are too rich (*) to be crazy courageous enough for fighting back for their ideals, for the freedom of seeing their beloved succeed and not crying their deaths. Soft times, soften people. Soften people, make hard times.</p><hr><p>The nowadays USA is in a completely different position. A reasonable estimation of the poor people is 41% not 11% because the parameters for poverty threshold in USA has not been updated since 1964, the year after the JFK died.</p><p>While the U.S. debt increased by 4.2x times - updated value by official inflation trend - but the grocery stores prices cast a more darker scenario. Plus the outrageous number of people addicted to Fentanyl.</p><p>In these conditions, Trump assassination would have sparked a riot that probably it would increased like an avalanche becoming a civil war (or a revolution). In front of this eventuality the U.S. government might have deliberately to carry on a first strike against Russia in order to start the WW3.</p><p>Because the WW3 would gave the chance to stay in power with the military law application. Then, people would have find themselves in front of two dramatic options: fighting a war against the Russia or fighting a war against their government while Russia was attacking back.</p><hr><p>Wise people would have turn down their government, before everything else. History teaches us that this rarely happens and the war works as the BIG RESET that the system would have wished to avoid.</p><p>Wise people always turn down their government, in case of doubts. It is so a natural response to put responsibility on those who lead or direct. In fact, they know so well that they use any kind of expedient for avoid it. Propaganda at the beginning, censorship immediately after, security control then, etc. etc., finally a war against a hard to beat enemy.</p><p>History is a continuous repetitions of this kind of plot. One thing over all, that history shows clearly that humans tend to do not learn enough or anything at all from the history. Hence, history makes rhymes.</p><p>It does not repeat, it makes rhymes. Paradoxically the JFK assassination did not lead to a riot nor a revolution but '68 while Trump assassination would have lead to a civil war. Rich people elaborate their grief with evasion while poor people with violence.</p><hr><h2>Note</h2><ul><li><p>You might wonder why Americans in 1963 were feeling being rich. When people are feeling that they are FREE to live with few bucks in the pocket or by their own work, they feel rich.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>Time line</h2><ul><li><p> <strong>9th July 2024</strong> - The NATO summit open in Washington D.C.</p></li><li><p>10th July 2024 - <a href="http://lnkd.in/dyY8HtzG" target="_blank">lnkd.in/dyY8HtzG</a> -Washington Summit Declaration.

The fake frame has been circulating online since at least 2017 and has been used in various disinformation contexts. Contacted by Reuters, Matt Selman, executive producer and showrunner of The Simpsons, confirmed that no such scene exists in the animated series, and that the image ‘has been faked’. --</em> lnkd.in/dYM9khcj</p><p>There! Do you see that the plan to assassinate Trump had already been premeditated since 2017? A bit conspiratorial as a statement, though!</p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQEcTxF7QjKoQQ" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQEcTxF7QjKoQQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1721138046801?e=1746057600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=mVYvw9lXJLB__fjlcPvpBtvUZigPtCU7VPF-hBFNGlQ"><figcaption><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_great-work-minions-simpsons-serie-confirms-activity-7218195230271950848-sJVW" target="_blank">Great work, Minions!</a> (14th July 2024)</figcaption></figure><p>I actually used a different way of expressing myself. The Simpsons series confirms: we have moved to a different universe line.</p><p>Different from what? From what the so-called ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation_theory" target="_blank">pre-bunking</a>’ was getting us used to thinking: that Trump should have died because The Simpsons predicted it and The Simpsons are never wrong!</p><p>A circularity of reasoning typical of madmen or people who have been unconsciously conditioned to think that something should happen, inevitably. But not the Minions, despite they are yellow as well.</p><p>The battlefield of the wars of the future (i.e. of today's wars) will not be the ground but the minds of the people. But propaganda is still a crude means: the more it works, the worse it ends up.</p><p>Like that other urban legend entitled: the stubborn lighthouse. That damn lighthouse, which stubbornly refused to give way to the US Navy. Less is more, and they would have crashed on the rocks.</p><p>Wild times, really. If Sigmund Freud (father of the psychoanalysis) were among us, I think he would agree that we have made this planet a madhouse or perhaps he would say: <em>mind your words kid, it was in my day too</em>. Yeah but in his days, few people knew that!</p><p>So back to a great classic, again: at the next round of evolution, I confidently bet on octopuses that they will fit as the intelligent life form to evolve...  🤣 </p><hr><hr><h3>Share alike</h3><p>© 2024, <a href="http://www.roberto.foglietta.name/" target="_blank">Roberto A.
