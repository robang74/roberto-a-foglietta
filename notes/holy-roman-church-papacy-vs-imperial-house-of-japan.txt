AI can do great good if properly governed, coupled with wariness about its misuse and the threat of dehumanizing values infiltrating society. Fascinating that the world's oldest still existing organization is quite progressive in relation of Artificial Intelligence.

Possibly

**Imperial House of Japan (Yamato Dynasty)**

- Traditional founding date: 660 BCE (by Emperor Jimmu, legendary first emperor)
- Historically verified line: From Emperor Sujin or Emperor Keitai (~1st to 5th century CE)
- Current emperor: Emperor Naruhito (126th monarch)
- Continuity: Unbroken hereditary line for over 2,600 years (according to tradition), and at least 1,500 years verified
- Unique trait: It is a symbolic monarchy today (post-World War II), but the institution still functions and maintains rituals, traditions, and lineage

#### Patrick Henz

Yes possibly, because it is based on Japanese mythology, though historical records date the first verifiable emperor, Emperor Ojin, to the 3rd or 4th century AD.

Everything is about strict standards definitions and their application in a fair and equal manner.

Church might be considered, as well, an organisation not before the Roman Emperor made it an acceptable religion. At that point can be considered an organisation. For sure, it was an organisation when another Roman Emperor decided that it was the official religion of the Roman Empire. Thus becoming the first pope, possibly. But when Papacy has been established as a monarchy. Because the same standards of evaluation should be fairly applied. Traditions, are vague. Organisation by its own definition are well-established otherwise are gossip.

Church 380 CE while Japanese Monarchy ~400 CE (verified) but which year precisely?

Cnsidering the historical organisation in a broader sense (any kind of organisation, including formal religion) the it started in 380 CE. Instead of independent and formally structured organisation (aka Papacy) it started in the 6th century. 

More or less with the same criterias fairly applied Church and Japanese Monarchy competing. While Japanese "traditions" are the oldest back in time, the Christianity develops a bit earlier a structure OR perhaps, our ability to track down the sources. Possibly the atomic bombs on Hiroshima distroyed some stuff which could have made some difference in archeological C-14 datation, or made it not reliable anymore.

The key of the debate, remains the Ōjin reign.

The whole research took no more than 50 minutes, identified the standards, and the crucial points. Plus, generates 2 documents.

Note of colour: the "AI Ethics for Peace" conference took place in Hiroshima, July 9th, 2024 by Rome call: "All religions are called to work together for the good of humanity inhabiting this planet, and for the preservation of the planet itself, the common home of every living being".

**Imperial House of Japan (historical research)**

The EBSCO article claims Ōjin Tennō (270–310 CE) is the first verifiable emperor, which seems to contradict other sources EBSCO Research Starters.

For rigorous comparison, both the Papacy and Japanese monarchy became formal organizations in the 6th century CE, though their pre-institutional histories differ in verifiability.
